The course website is located
[here](https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Natural-Language-Processing-28b213a83886806982a5c03b425595c4?source=copy_link).
Lecture materials, assignments, quizzes, etc. can be accessed at that
link.

This site contains jupyter notebooks, data and other code artifacts
associated with this course. I recommend you run these notebooks in
Google Colab since they are tested in that environment. However, you are
free to download and run elsewhere.

I will add further instructions for running locally or on some other
environment if course-specific modules are needed.
