The course website is located
[here](https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Natural-Language-Processing-28b213a83886806982a5c03b425595c4?source=copy_link).
Lecture materials, assignments, quizzes, etc. can be accessed at that
link.

This site contains jupyter notebooks, data and other code artifacts
associated with this course. I recommend you run these notebooks in
Google Colab since they are tested in that environment. However, you are
free to download and run elsewhere.

I will add further instructions for running locally or on some other
environment if course-specific modules are needed.

## Installation

### For Students (Google Colab / Deepnote)

The easiest way to use this package is in Google Colab or Deepnote. In
the first cell of your notebook, run:

``` python
# Install the package with all NLP dependencies
!pip install -q data401-nlp[all]

# The spaCy model will be automatically downloaded when needed
from data401_nlp.helpers.spacy import ensure_spacy_model
nlp = ensure_spacy_model("en_core_web_sm")
```

### For Local Development

If you want to run the notebooks locally:

``` bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/su-dataAI/data401-nlp.git
cd data401-nlp

# Install with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,all]"

# Download spaCy model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab
```

### Installation Options

The package supports flexible installation based on your needs:

``` bash
# Minimal installation (core utilities only)
pip install data401-nlp

# With NLP tools (spaCy, NLTK)
pip install data401-nlp[nlp]

# With transformers and PyTorch
pip install data401-nlp[transformers]

# With API support (FastAPI, Pydantic)
pip install data401-nlp[api]

# Everything (recommended for students)
pip install data401-nlp[all]
```

### Platform Support

✅ Google Colab  
✅ Deepnote  
✅ Jupyter Lab  
✅ Local Python 3.11+

### Helper Modules

The package includes several helper modules to make your NLP work
easier:

- `data401_nlp.helpers.env` - Environment detection and API key loading
- `data401_nlp.helpers.spacy` - Automatic spaCy model management
- `data401_nlp.helpers.submit` - Assignment submission utilities
- `data401_nlp.helpers.llm` - LLM integration helpers
