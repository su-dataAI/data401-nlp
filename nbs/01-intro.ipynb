    "\n",
    "This notebook represents a departure from the usual order in which one learns basic concepts in NLP. And, perhaps, in this LLM era, there is no usual progression anymore! \n",
    "\n",
    "Pedagogically, **[Jurafsky and Martin (3rd. ed.)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)** sets a standard by which many follow. Yet, it's an incredibly lengthy and dense book oriented largely towards graduate students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is learning NLP using an incremental and human language-centered approach to NLP, while also committing to libraries that students will be expected to know as data scientists in the work environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**[SpaCy v.3](https://spacy.io)** provides a staggeringly rich ecosystem for NLP development suitable both for data science experimentation and enterprise deployment. It is a defacto industry standard that integrates well with other common tools used by data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a whirlwind tour of spaCy. You will gain familiarity with spaCy container objects -- notably, **Doc** (sequence of token objects) and **Token** objects. Tokens themselves contain text annotations as processed by components in the spaCy pipeline. *Don't worry if you don't understand everything that's going on. The hope is that by the end of the class, you will!*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is also designed to tackle linguistic concepts as we encounter them, while starting from the most natural place to learn linguistic processing -- within the spaCy pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we're going to tackle learning traditional NLP methods alongside LLMs. Traditional methods include predictive AI methods that well complement generative AI techniques. We're going to think about when and how to use both... and sometimes together."

    "\n",
    "**Lemmas** are the base or dictionary form of a word. For example:\n",
    "- \"joined\" → \"join\"\n",
    "- \"running\" → \"run\"  \n",
    "- \"better\" → \"good\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This normalization is useful because it lets you treat different forms of the same word as equivalent. For instance, if you're analyzing sentiment in reviews, you'd want \"loved,\" \"loving,\" and \"loves\" to all be recognized as the same concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stop words** are common words that often don't carry much meaning on their own, like \"the,\" \"is,\" \"at,\" \"in,\" \"a.\" You can see in your token table that words like \"in\" and \"on\" are marked as stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're often filtered out in tasks like:\n",
    "- Document classification (where \"the\" appears everywhere and doesn't help distinguish topics)\n",
    "- Keyword extraction (you want meaningful words, not \"and\" or \"of\")\n",
    "\n",
    "However, stop words ARE important for some tasks—like machine translation or question answering, where \"not\" or \"who\" can completely change meaning!\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at your sample text, can you spot why lemmatization might be helpful for analyzing this text? What if you wanted to count how many times people \"work\" at different companies across many documents?"

    "**SpaCy's behavior**: It makes a single parse decision for each sentence. It chose ATTRIBUTE for the ambiguous cases and INSTRUMENT when \"my\" appears (which is a strong syntactic cue).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The LM's behavior**: It consistently prefers INSTRUMENT across all sentences when scoring the two continuations. However, notice the \"Distribution\" column shows FLAT for all - this means at the cut point, the model sees multiple plausible next words with similar probabilities, reflecting genuine uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The mismatch**: The LM's top-1 predictions (sword, hands, eye) don't match the actual words in the sentences. This shows the model is considering many possibilities, not committing to one interpretation early.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's particularly interesting is that even though the distribution is FLAT (uncertain), when we force the model to score complete continuations, it shows a preference. Can you think on why this may be?\n",
