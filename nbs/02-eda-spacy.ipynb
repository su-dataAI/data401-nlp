Two searches were conducted, with a maximum number of English language tweets of 5000, and with retweets filtered out during collection.\n",

    "1. #covidhoax OR #notomask\n",
    "2. #covidisreal OR #wearmask\n",

    "This collection was created specifically for students of NLP in a prior semester. The data is not representative of any population and is not intended for publication or re-distribution. \n",

    "\n",
    "Please do not share or post these csv files. Despite changes in Twitter ownership, they come with licensing restrictions. In the past, I had students collect this data individually. Since that's no longer an easy option, you will use pre-collected data. The [licensing restriction applicable to the 2020 collection is documented here](https://github.com/KatherineMichel/stanford-code-in-place-final-project/blob/master/twitter-developer-agreement-march-10.md). \n",

    "\n",
    "> In practice, for a small academic exercise: it is acceptable to share a modest tweet subset with students inside your course context, provided it is non‑commercial, secured, not a bulk replacement for the API, and you honor deletion/visibility changes and the privacy and usage rules in the Developer Policy.\n"

    "### Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it, keywords are a way of finding words that are more frequent in one corpus than another. What distinguishes one text from another?\n",
    "\n",
    "A keyword list is calculated by comparing 2 frequency lists together – usually a much larger **reference corpus** against a smaller specialised corpus (but sometimes 2 equal sized corpora). We're looking for words that are more frequent in one list when compared to the other. Given we don't have a reference corpus in this lab, we'll compare our two small datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use inferential statistics such as chi-square or log-likelihood test identify the words that are statistically much more frequent in one list when compared to the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to decide when is a word should be considered a keyword. To do this, we apply cut-off points for statistical\n",
    "significance. Or you could set an arbitrary cutoff such as look at the top 10 or 20 words (tokens) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, sometimes a minimum frequency is applied (e.g. a word must occur 20 times before it’s a keyword). Just because a word is rare is not necessarily a keyword. We'll look at an example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we may specify a keyword has to be reasonably well-distributed (occurring in at least 20 texts, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common types of keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Proper nouns (Clegg, Ghana etc)\n",
    "2. Markers of style (often grammatical words like must, betwixt)\n",
    "3. Spelling idiosyncrasies (color/colour)\n",
    "4. “Aboutness” words (politics, recipe etc) \n",
    "\n",
    "What’s the point of this...\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords identify **salient** words in a corpus, acting as **signposts** for a linguistic, cultural or discursive analysis Exploring why they’re there and what they do can lead to interesting questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Humans have cognitive biases when it comes to noticing frequencies. Thus, se use statistical methods that are reproducible, and have high reliability/validity from a scientific perspective. "

    "**Collocations** are sequences of words that co-occur unusually frequently and that over time start to take on a meaning or a salience that resists the token sequence being broken down into its individual parts. \n",

    "Often words that start off as collocations become increasingly fixed as lexical items, especially when they are used with great frequency. This process is called **lexicalization**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, as noun-noun collocations such as 'ice chest', 'data base' or 'war game' become increasingly cemented in the vocabulary of English, even native speakers pause to wonder 'Does ice-chest have a hyphen? Is database all one word? **That is a sign of the increasing lexicalization of the collocation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you can introspect about whether a collocation has a non-compositional meaning by trying to substitute it with a single synonym, such as 'cooler' for 'icechest' or 'assassin' for 'hit man' (or is that hitman?) Collocations can consist of numerous combinations of parts-of-speech, but most have in common the somewhat idiosyncratic nature of their meaning, which can exhibit differing degrees of compositionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a challenge for second language learners, and websites such as 7esl devote some effort to helping people master them. For the purposes of natural language processing, when setting out to answer an analytic question with natural language data, it is important to consider whether and to what degree identifying collocations is relevant and necessary. How you treat collocations can affect everything from first order frequency counts to the quality of word embeddings, which are so widely used in contemporary machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n-grams** (also written **ngrams**), are collcations. We'll talk about this term many times throughout the course, because n-grams are so central to language modeling in NLP. The n in n-gram is meant to represent a variable of any length. The gram in n-gram is a graphical representation of some chunk of language, which might be characters, morphemes, tokens, or words. Some of the shorter n-grams have special names, such as bigram or trigram, which are 2-grams and 3-grams, respectively.\n",
