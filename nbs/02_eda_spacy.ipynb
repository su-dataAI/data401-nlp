    "- In spaCy, **a lexeme is \"a word type, as opposed to a word token,\"** stored in Vocab and shared by all tokens with the same ORTH (string hash).\n",
    "- spaCy maintains a StringStore mapping each distinct string to a unique integer ID; the same ID (ORTH) is used to index a Lexeme in Vocab.\n",

    "- **Text preprocessing** involves many analytic decisions. Every decision affects downstream analyses such as vocabulary, frequency counts, and analyses. \n",
    "- **Raw frequency** is rarely informative on its own; normalization and relative measures are necessary to compare groups of different sizes meaningfully.\n",
    "- **Dispersion** complements frequency by showing where language appears, helping distinguish widespread usage from repetition, coordination, or amplification.\n",
    "- **Keyword-in-context (KWIC)** analysis grounds statistics in real language use, revealing how the same word can serve different functions across groups and exposing preprocessing artifacts.\n",
    "- **Lemmatization** shifts analysis from surface form to meaning, reducing sparsity and enabling clearer comparisons of lexical variety and shared vs. group-specific vocabulary.\n",
