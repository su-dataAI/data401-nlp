    "  - File and database search tools\n",
    "  - Programming languages such as Perl, Python, Java…\n",
    "  - Grep \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not standardized\n",
    "  - Different applications use different \"flavors\"\n",
    "  - You should learn the basics of what you *can* do\n",
    "      - details of *how* to do it in different regex flavors will follow from that\n",
    "  - We will focus on Python re and regex libraries\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Flexible\n",
    "    - There are usually multiple regexes that can be used to describe or capture a pattern\n",
    "    - Some tradeoffs:\n",
    "        - readability\n",
    "        - precision\n",

    "This class may be part of the \"tweener\" generation between those that have had to learn regular expressions and practice them, and those that may use LLMs to write them.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are very good at writing regular expressions when the intent is clear, constrained, and testable — and noticeably worse when intent is vague, underspecified, or linguistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of regexes in training data and LLMs should be very good at matching canonical patterns. But if you are the least bit unclear, you will can get a poor, but confident answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "My best advise is:\n",
    "- Practice writing regular expressions so you are comfortable working them. You want to be able to confidently identify when there is a problem.\n",
    "- When you practice start with the smallest, simplest expression in a tool like [https://regexr.com](https://regexr.com) and then gradually build up, while visually confirming with test text that it's doing what you want. (This is more fun than wordle.)\n",
    "- Get your LLM code assistant to write tests, before you get help with writing the regex. LLMs are good at writing tests, though you might not want to entirely rely on them.\n"

No. Whether someone wants to have children or not should be completely up to the person carrying that pregnancy... I will agree to gay marriage if you agree to pro-life and then adopt babies that would have been aborted.

YES. Freedom from the fear of rape and sexual objectification? YES. The \\'right\\' to abort? NO. @explicit0ceans whoa whoa whoa.

Male politicians deciding what women should do with their body\\'s. I was born 4 months premature... I\\'m perfectly fine, somehow killing babies is legal in this country.

No. Whether someone wants to have children or not should be completely up to the person carrying that pregnancy... I will agree to gay marriage if you agree to pro-life and then adopt babies that would have been aborted.

YES. Freedom from the fear of rape and sexual objectification? YES. The \\'right\\' to abort? NO. @explicit0ceans whoa whoa whoa. I don\\'t care about you having sex, but when you\\'re pregnant, there\\'s another life involved. Today I am grateful to have the right to control my body without govt influence. #antichoice leaders want to stop this. #abvote Sadly, most health insurance plans don\\'t cover abortions, so the price can be quite high.... @Britt_Ghiroli @mboyle1 But the Mayor of Baltimore said to give rioters to rioters. #BlackLivesMatter #Except2Democrats #Sanger It is so much fun having younger friends who are expecting babies. #beentheredonethat #chooselife Why is it illegal to kill an unhatched eagle egg but its legal to kill an unborn human baby?isright I refuse to let people like you shame and insult women for accessing healthcare. Sorry. Just no.  pro-life? no you\\'re more pro-birth then after that the baby can support itself!!! #makesnosense #prowomen U know what isn\\'t funny? Male politicians deciding what women should do with their body\\'s. I was born 4 months premature... I\\'m perfectly fine, somehow killing babies is legal in this country.
