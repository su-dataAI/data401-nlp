You’ll be asked to consider how or why an LLM can do things that pose challenges for traditional NLP and statistical methods. As before, think and respond before asking an AI model for insight. We’ll go much more deeply into how things work as we go in this class.\nWhile this lab is labeled EDA part 2, non of it is strictly needed by your EDA.

    "text": "Preface - Distributional Analysis\nSection A on word association patterns will introduce measures that are not intended to be part of your EDA project. Instead, it sets up how we use statistics to tease out patterns in language. These patterns are the thread that connect linguistic analysis, to traditional NLP, to modern LLMs. We’ll come back to the same statistical principles repeatedly through this course.\nAssociation patterns make explicit distributional analysis at a very local level. Distributional analysis rest on a single, core idea: A word’s meaning (or function) is reflected in how it is distributed across contexts. Two groups may share the use of a set of words, and yet those words take on different meaning in different contexts.\nFor example, in the promask context: ‘mask’ occurs with words such as protect, safe, others, community, health. In the antimask context, it appears with words such as forced, control, lie, hoax, freedom. Although both groups use the word “mask” frequently, its meaning is shaped by the associative context in which it appears. Neither is right nor wrong – this is an observation about how language is used… which is observable in the data. Meaning is not just about which words are used, but about the contexts in which they are used.\nIn section A, we’ll use this idea to observe differences in how language is used between two groups.",

    "text": "A - Word Association Patterns\nBefore we move on to playing with other spaCy pipeline capabilities on this data, let’s talk about the utility of word associations to reveal patterns in data. These techniques are used to reveal patterns in language. Very similar statistical methods are used to build word embeddings, which we’ll explore soon. Embeddings are a key tool for LLMs.\nWhat I hope you draw from this is that we have more tools at our disposal for looking at patterns in language data when it comes to squishy questions around the social use of language such as attitude, opinion, ideology, power, etc. If statistics excites you, this is an interesting area of study and could be valuable tool in investigative journalism, mental health, social justice, etc.\nAt the heart of of statistical methods for studying language use is co-occurence and frequencies of words and word patterns.\nA basic way to study co-occurrence patterns is through bigrams, which are adjacent pairs of tokens. Bigrams define what counts as a co-occurrence.\nOnce we have bigram counts, we can ask whether two tokens appear together more often than we would expect by chance, given their individual frequencies.\nThe underlying assumption is token independence: if two words are unrelated, the probability of seeing them together should be predictable from their unigram frequencies. Association measures test departures from this assumption. Thus association measures evaluate whether that co-occurence is statistically meaningful.\nStatistical such as Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), t-score, or log-likelihood quantify this likelihood of association by comparing observed bigram frequencies to expected frequencies under an independence assumption.\nWhile this lab is too long to go into depth about any of these inferential techniques, let’s focus on normalizing our frequencies and incorporate sampling. If your data set is large, this is what you will need to do. Below, we’ll reduce the number of documents to 1000. Sampling is a great way to work out ideas before you do a full analysis.\n\nnlp = get_nlp()\n\ndf[\"token_count\"] = df[\"clean_text\"].apply(\n    lambda text: len(\n        [tok for tok in nlp(text) if not tok.is_space]\n    )\n)\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n\n\n\n# sample rows *with* group so alignment is preserved\nMAX_DOCS = 1000\ndf_s = (\n    df[[\"clean_text\", \"group\", \"token_count\"]]\n    .dropna(subset=[\"clean_text\", \"group\"])\n    .sample(n=min(MAX_DOCS, len(df)), random_state=42)\n    .reset_index(drop=True)\n)\n\nnlp = get_nlp()\ndocs_s = list(nlp.pipe(df_s[\"clean_text\"], batch_size=1000))\n\ndocs_promask = [d for d, g in zip(docs_s, df_s[\"group\"]) if g == \"promask\"]\ndocs_antimask = [d for d, g in zip(docs_s, df_s[\"group\"]) if g == \"antimask\"]\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n\n\nBelow, let’s recall how we normalize frequencies to compare patterns across groups. I played around with removing things we’re less interested in for this analysis such as punctuation and spaces. Freel free to play around with this, as well!

Two words can be frequent without being meaningfully related. To capture relationships between words, we need to look at co-occurrence.\n\nCollocations\nWhile comparing termlists against other term lists is interesting, let’s shift to looking at the co-occurence of words with other words. The simplest way to do this is to look at bigrams.\nBigrams in our context are pairs of words or tokens. Here’s an example below. We’ll need to use bigrams and unigrams (single word/token frequencies) for some of the statistics below.\n\nnlp = get_nlp()\ndoc = nlp(\"I love wearing masks\")\nbigrams = [(doc[i].text, doc[i+1].text) for i in range(len(doc)-1)]\nprint(bigrams)\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n[('I', 'love'), ('love', 'wearing'), ('wearing', 'masks')]\n\n\nCollocations are sequences of words that co-occur unusually frequently and that, over time, start to take on a meaning or a salience that resists the token sequence being broken down into its individual parts.\nOften words that start off as collocations become increasingly fixed as lexical items, especially when they are used with great frequency. This process is called lexicalization.\nFor example, as noun-noun collocations such as ‘ice chest’, ‘data base’ or ‘war game’ become increasingly cemented in the vocabulary of English, even native speakers pause to wonder ’Does ice-chest have a hyphen? Is database all one word? That is a sign of the increasing lexicalization of the collocation.\nIn some cases, you can introspect about whether a collocation has a non-compositional meaning by trying to substitute it with a single synonym, such as ‘cooler’ for ‘icechest’ or ‘assassin’ for ‘hit man’ (or is that hitman?) Collocations can consist of numerous combinations of parts-of-speech, but most have in common the somewhat idiosyncratic nature of their meaning, which can exhibit differing degrees of compositionality.\nThis is a challenge for second language learners, and websites such as 7esl devote some effort to helping people master them. For the purposes of natural language processing, when setting out to answer an analytic question with natural language data, it is important to consider whether and to what degree identifying collocations is relevant and necessary. How you treat collocations can affect everything from first order frequency counts to the quality of word embeddings, which are so widely used in contemporary machine learning.\nn-grams (also written ngrams), are collcations. We’ll talk about this term many times throughout the course, because n-grams are so central to language modeling in NLP. The n in n-gram is meant to represent a variable of any length. The gram in n-gram is a graphical representation of some chunk of language, which might be characters, morphemes, tokens, or words. Some of the shorter n-grams have special names, such as bigram or trigram, which are 2-grams and 3-grams, respectively.\nCollocation measures of words are a kind of association measure that calculates the strength of association between words. There are many different association measures, but they all work on the same basic principle: they compare the observed frequency of a pair of words with the expected.\nUseful to data scientists are the collocation graphs. Collocation graphs visually map which words commonly appear together in language. By treating words as nodes and their relationships as edges, they help us see patterns of meaning, usage, and discourse structure.\n\nFor collocation analysis (word associations within a corpus), these are fairly typical statistics that we can use. I won’t go into how these are calculated, since this is just a demonstration.\nThere are a number of different statistics. To choose one, you have to define the type of collocation that you are interested in. Here is a chart from page 74 in Brezina’s “Statistics in Corpus Linguistics” book.\n\nThis image highlights that some terms occur more frequently together, and some words predominantly occur only with one another.\nAll of these tests start with the same idea - what gets weighted: surprise vs frequency. They all compare observed co-occurence to expected co-occurence under independence. But they differ in how much they pernalize or reward rare events.\nWe’ll look at PMI, in particular.

This allows them to generalize beyond fixed bigrams/trigrams… and as a result, they can recognize meaningful associations even when rare, indirect, or distributed.",

    "section": "B - Parts-of-Speech Patterns",
    "text": "B - Parts-of-Speech Patterns\nSo far, we’ve treated text primarily as sequences of tokens, asking which words tend to appear together and how strongly those associations depart from chance. Another way to surface structure in language is to step back from which words are used and look instead at how grammatical resources are distributed. It’s not only “words” or tokens that have distributional patterns – grammatical categories do, too!\nThis is where linguistic annotation—specifically part-of-speech (POS) tagging—becomes useful. Rather than measuring association between specific lexical items, POS patterns let us examine higher-level distributional constructs, such as whether a group relies more on nouns versus verbs, descriptive adjectives versus evaluative ones, or personal pronouns versus impersonal constructions. In this section, we return to spaCy’s pipeline annotations to explore how grammatical patterns can complement word-level association analysis.\nWe won’t use POS for this EDA because it is not reliable on Twitter data. Tweets contain nonstandard spelling, emojis, hashtags, and fragmented syntax, which fall outside the data most POS taggers are trained on.\nThe spaCy POS tagger was primarily trained on newswire, magazines, blogs and other well formed, and cleaned texts. If your EDA is centered on this sort of text, POS may be useful in your EDA.\nPOS can be useful for examining: - NOUN density. How much is information-heavy vs opinion-heavy - ADJ frequency. Evaluative language - PRON patterns. Personal involvement\nFirst, we’ll take a peek at how compute a POS distribution. Then we will play around with modal verbs. I hope that exploring patterns via POS gives you ideas about how to use these sorts of annotations.\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef get_pos_distribution(texts, nlp, allowed_pos=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute normalized POS tag distribution using batched spaCy processing.\n    \"\"\"\n    if allowed_pos is None:\n        allowed_pos = {\n            \"NOUN\", \"PROPN\", \"VERB\", \"ADJ\", \"ADV\",\n            \"PRON\", \"DET\", \"ADP\", \"AUX\"\n        }\n\n    pos_counts = Counter()\n\n    for doc in nlp.pipe(texts, batch_size=1000):\n        for tok in doc:\n            if tok.pos_ in allowed_pos:\n                pos_counts[tok.pos_] += 1\n\n    total = sum(pos_counts.values())\n    return {pos: count / total for pos, count in pos_counts.items()}\n\n\npos_dist_promask = get_pos_distribution(\n    df[df['group'] == 'promask']['clean_text'], nlp\n)\n\npos_dist_antimask = get_pos_distribution(\n    df[df['group'] == 'antimask']['clean_text'], nlp\n)\n\npos_dist_promask, pos_dist_antimask\n\n({'NOUN': 0.31143695766415874,\n  'ADP': 0.08735051718171215,\n  'PROPN': 0.11481818531383381,\n  'PRON': 0.10053961214575936,\n  'AUX': 0.0600751099091247,\n  'ADV': 0.04566836283469411,\n  'DET': 0.06581730091387995,\n  'ADJ': 0.07186710929388995,\n  'VERB': 0.14242684474294723},\n {'NOUN': 0.2847861563568064,\n  'ADP': 0.08756966468577762,\n  'PRON': 0.09951658096499061,\n  'AUX': 0.07383686916895034,\n  'ADV': 0.05055885703728793,\n  'DET': 0.07907134279644056,\n  'VERB': 0.13954490870462175,\n  'ADJ': 0.08430581642393079,\n  'PROPN': 0.10080980386119408})\n\n\nBecause POS tagging is noisy on Twitter, small differences should be treated as suggestive patterns, not explanations.\nIf we’re just looking at proportionality of POS, a few patterns stand out:\n\nPROPN (proper nouns) — These are slightly more frequent in promask tweets. This could reflects more use of named entities.\nDET (determiners) and AUX (auxiliaries) — These are slightly more frequent in antimask tweets. We don’t know why, though may correlate with more declarative constructions.\nADV (adverbs) and ADJ (adjectives) — Little differences across groups. This could suggest evaluative language is present in both groups. Evaluative language uses words and phrases to express judgment, opinion, or attitude (positive, negative, or neutral) about a topic, rather than just stating facts.\n\nPOS tags capture surface grammatical categories, not meaning. On short, informal texts like tweets, POS distributions are especially sensitive to: - emoji and punctuation - hashtags and mentions - fragmented or non-standard syntax\nFor our analysis of twitter data, it is best treated as contextual, and not explanatory.\nNow let’s look at the frequency of modal verbs. Modal verbs (typically auxiliary verbs) express modality—obligation, permission, or possibility—and often signal prescriptive or normative language.\nWe’ll look at several types of modality: - Strong obligation: must, need to - Weaker obligation: should, ought to - Prohibition: can’t, must not, shouldn’t\nWe could also consider imperative verbs (e.g., “wear!”, “stop!”, “wake up!”) — they’re prescriptive too.\n\nmodals = {\n    'strong': ['must', 'need', 'have'],  # \"have to\" needs special handling\n    'medium': ['should', 'ought'],\n    'weak': ['can', 'could', 'may', 'might']\n}\n\n\n# build inverse mapping: lemma -&gt; strength\nmodal_to_strength = {\n    modal: strength\n    for strength, modal_list in modals.items()\n    for modal in modal_list\n}\n\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef get_modal_counts_from_docs(docs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count modal verbs from pre-parsed spaCy Docs.\n    Restricts to AUX tokens to avoid false positives.\n    \"\"\"\n    modal_counts = Counter()\n\n    for doc in docs:\n        for tok in doc:\n            if tok.pos_ == \"AUX\":\n                strength = modal_to_strength.get(tok.lemma_.lower())\n                if strength:\n                    modal_counts[strength] += 1\n\n    return modal_counts\n\nmodals_promask = get_modal_counts_from_docs(docs_promask)\nmodals_antimask = get_modal_counts_from_docs(docs_antimask)\n\nmodals_promask, modals_antimask\n\n(Counter({'weak': 83, 'strong': 51, 'medium': 12}),\n Counter({'strong': 35, 'weak': 29, 'medium': 3}))\n\n\n\nlen(docs_promask), len(docs_antimask)\n\n(714, 286)\n\n\nBecause the two groups contain different numbers of tweets and tokens, raw counts are not directly comparable. To account for corpus size, we normalize modal counts per 1,000 tokens.\n\n# Normalized modal rates per 1000 tokens (same sample as modal counts)\ntotal_promask_tokens = df_s[df_s[\"group\"] == \"promask\"][\"token_count\"].sum()\ntotal_antimask_tokens = df_s[df_s[\"group\"] == \"antimask\"][\"token_count\"].sum()\n\nrate_strong_promask = modals_promask.get(\"strong\", 0) / total_promask_tokens * 1000\nrate_strong_antimask = modals_antimask.get(\"strong\", 0) / total_antimask_tokens * 1000\n\nrate_strong_promask, rate_strong_antimask\n\n(np.float64(3.3320266562132494), np.float64(5.868544600938967))\n\n\nModal verbs appear in both corpora, which tells us that normative and possibility-oriented language is common across the discourse. When normalized by token count, strong modals (e.g. must, need (to), have (to)) occur more frequently in antimask tweets.\nWe can only make a cautious interpretation without pulling out KWIC and studying these tweets by eye - possibly, they represent more prescriptive framing. This sort of analysis could go into an EDA, though you can draw no conclusions without carefully examining the data.",

    "text": "C - Named Entity Recognition\nSo far, we’ve used token counts, collocations, and POS patterns to surface lexical and grammatical regularities in the corpus. Another common way to structure text analytically is to identify named entities—mentions of people, organizations, locations, and other real-world referents. This is the goal of Named Entity Recognition (NER).\nAs with POS tagging, spaCy’s NER component was trained primarily on edited, well-formed text, not social media, so we should expect noisy and imperfect results on Twitter data. Nonetheless, examining entity types and co-occurrence patterns is still useful for understanding what kinds of actors and institutions are being referenced and for practicing how entity-based analyses are performed. In this section, we briefly explore NER as another surface-level annotation that complements earlier frequency and association analyses.\nSome patterns we might be interested in:\nAggregate across corpus - PERSON mentions (authorities, politicians, scientists) - ORG mentions (CDC, WHO, government agencies) - GPE (locations - local vs. national vs. international framing) - DATE (temporal framing differences)\nHow well might we be able to detect people mentions?\nHow well might we be able to find interesting patterns of co-occurence of entities? - Which entities appear together in tweets? - Example: “Fauci” + “lie” vs. “Fauci” + “expert” - Simple co-occurrence matrix for top 10 entities\nLater, we will talk about how must evaluate the quality of NER. For now, let’s just practice using it.\n\n# We'll speed this up by disabling a few components since we're only looking at entity types\n\ndef get_entity_types(texts, nlp):\n    ent_counts = Counter()\n    for doc in nlp.pipe(\n    texts,\n    batch_size=1000,\n    disable=[\"tagger\", \"parser\", \"lemmatizer\"]\n):\n        ent_counts.update(ent.label_ for ent in doc.ents)\n    return ent_counts\n\nents_promask = get_entity_types(\n    df[df[\"group\"] == \"promask\"][\"tweet_text\"],\n    nlp\n)\n\nnlp = get_nlp()\nents_antimask = get_entity_types(\n    df[df[\"group\"] == \"antimask\"][\"tweet_text\"],\n    nlp\n)\nents_promask.most_common(10), ents_antimask.most_common(10)\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n\n\n([('PERSON', 2304),\n  ('CARDINAL', 1891),\n  ('ORG', 1698),\n  ('DATE', 911),\n  ('MONEY', 818),\n  ('GPE', 671),\n  ('NORP', 211),\n  ('TIME', 142),\n  ('PRODUCT', 112),\n  ('ORDINAL', 92)],\n [('PERSON', 943),\n  ('ORG', 858),\n  ('CARDINAL', 654),\n  ('PRODUCT', 528),\n  ('MONEY', 296),\n  ('GPE', 291),\n  ('DATE', 273),\n  ('NORP', 155),\n  ('PERCENT', 78),\n  ('ORDINAL', 35)])\n\n\nWe use nlp.pipe() rather than calling nlp(text) in a loop because spaCy is optimized for batch processing.

At an aggregate level, spaCy’s NER surfaces broad patterns—such as the prominence of PERSON, ORG, GPE, and DATE mention. However, on Twitter data the results are noisy and unstable at the token level. Hashtags, emojis, creative spellings, and slogans seem to be misclassified as entities.\nWhile potentially interesting, this exploratory analysis is not particularly revealing about stance, irony, causality, or implied meaning. Differences should be interpreted as descriptive patterns, not explanations.\nWe include NER here not because it performs well on Twitter, but because it is a standard NLP technique that illustrates where classical annotation begins to break down. The main lesson here is not what entities are mentioned, but how brittle entity-based analysis becomes in informal, ideological discourse.\n\n\nReflection\n\nWhat aspects of linguistic variety were detectable using word frequency, corpus statistics, and spaCy’s rule-based or statistical methods?

    "section": "D - LLM Analysis",
    "text": "D - LLM Analysis\nUp to this point, we’ve relied on corpus statistics and spaCy’s linguistic annotations to surface patterns in word choice, grammatical structure, and reference. These methods scale well, are transparent, and make their assumptions explicit—but they also operate largely at the level of surface form. As we’ve seen, they struggle with phenomena that depend on broader context, such as sarcasm, irony, implied stance, emoji usage, and the internal semantics of hashtags.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) approach text from a different angle. Rather than counting or labeling isolated units, they model language as a conditional sequence, integrating information across entire utterances and drawing on patterns learned from massive amounts of prior text. This allows them to infer pragmatic meaning, ideological signals, and non-literal usage that classical methods leave opaque. In this section, we explore what LLM-based analysis can reveal about this same dataset—and how its strengths complement, rather than replace, the methods we’ve used so far.\nClassical NLP excels at counting and labeling what is explicit; LLMs excel at inferring what is implicit and contextual.\n\nD.1 - Hashtags\nHashtags are interesting and linguistically odd: - No spaces: #CovidIsntReal - Mixed case semantics: #wearAMask vs #WearAMask vs #WEARAMASK - Compound meanings: #DoYourOwnResearch (literal + ideological signal) - Emoji integration: #MaskUp😷 or #NoMasks🙅‍♂️ - Sarcasm markers: #TrustTheScience (could be genuine or mocking)\nCould we create custom functions to break hashtags into words? With some effort and degree of error, yes. As it stands, spaCy treats hashtags as proper nouns, doesn’t parse internal structure, and can’t interpret emoji semantics. POS won’t help us much… nor will NER or spaCy dependency parsing.

While classical NLP treats hashtags as atomic tokens and misses the many ways in which they are used to express feelings, stance, irony, group signaling - LLMs can infer them.\nThat said, LLM interpretations are plausible analyses, not ground truth. Unlike POS tags or frequency counts, their outputs cannot be directly validated. Claims about stance, irony, or intent should therefore be treated as hypotheses that require external validation (e.g., human annotation, inter-annotator agreement, or task-based evaluation). The value of LLM analysis here lies in sense-making and exploration, not definitive measurement.\n\nReflection\n\nWhat signals were invisible to corpus stats and spaCy?\nHow do you think the LLM ‘knows’ that 🐑 is being used ironically here? Where does that knowledge come from? (Consider distributional information.)\nThe LLM recognizes ‘#DoYourOwnResearch’ as ideologically loaded. How do you think it learn that association? Could we build that classically?\n\n\nq5_answer = \"What information did LLMs infer that SpaCy components couldn't?\"\n\n\nq6_answer = \"How did the LLM know that 🐑 indicated irony?\"\n\n\nq7_answer = \"How did the LLM recognizes an association of #DoYourOwnResearch to ideology?\"\n\n\n\n\nD.2 Stance Detection\nWhile, hashtags and emoji can signal ideology, irony, or group identity without explicitly stating a position, stance asks how a speaker positions themselves toward a target. For example, they can indicate whether they support, reject, mock, or distance themselves from an idea.‘Stance’ indicates a position on a target (e.g., a topic).\nUnlike sentiment, which captures positive or negative tone, stance captures a position toward a specific target, even when sentiment is ambiguous or ironic.\nStance isn’t always explicit. People signal positions through: - Sarcasm and irony - Rhetorical questions - Tone and affect\nLet’s look at tweet pairs that look superficially similar.\n\ndef llm_analyze_tweet(model=DEFAULT_MODEL):\n    \"Analyze stance and use of language and emoji\"\n\n    if not llm_available():\n        return (\n            \"Summary unavailable\\n\\n\"\n            \"• LLM disabled or unavailable\\n\"\n            \"• Skipping abstractive summarization\\n\"\n            \"• Proceeding with notebook execution\"\n        )\n    \n    prompt = f\"\"\"Analyze this tweet for linguistic and social signals:\n   \nTweet 1: , \"Wow, masks really work 😂\"\n\nTweet 2: \"Science says masks work.

Tweets that appear superficially similar can express sharply different stances.\nThat said, resuts should be read interpretively and not determinitically. The LLM is not “detecting” stance, but generating plausible explanations based on patterns learned over very large amounts of text. LLMs are great for exploring ideas, generating hypotheses and filling in gaps where surface-level signals break down.\nThe stance analysis is best understood as interpretive sense-making, not a classification result.\n\nReflection\n\nThe LLM ‘knows’ that 😂 + positive claim often = sarcasm. How did it learn this? Could we build an ML model to detect this or encode it as a rule?\nAre these confidence levels real or simply generated patterns? How could we tell?\nHow do we know the LLM is right? For spaCy, we can check POS tags manually. For stance detection, what’s our ground truth?\n\n\nq3_answer = \"Could we use rules or ML to detect sarcasm?\"\n\n\nq4_answer = \"Are confidence levels given by an LLM real or simply generated?\"\n\n\nq5_answer = \"How could we validate whether an LLM is right?\"",

    "text": "Lab Summary\nIn this lab, you explored how different analytical approaches surface different kinds of structure in text. Using corpus statistics and spaCy’s linguistic annotations, you examined lexical patterns, word associations, grammatical distributions, and referential structure across two contrasting Twitter corpora. You saw how frequency counts, bigrams, and association measures like PMI highlight recurring and slogan-like language, while POS tagging and modal analysis offer a coarse view of grammatical and normative patterns—albeit with clear limitations on informal social media data.\nYou also observed where classical NLP methods begin to break down. POS tagging and NER, while standard and scalable, proved noisy and brittle in the presence of hashtags, emojis, sarcasm, and fragmented syntax. In contrast, LLM-based analyses demonstrated an ability to integrate multiple weak signals—lexical choice, punctuation, emoji, and pragmatic context—to generate plausible interpretations of stance, irony, and ideological signaling. However, these interpretations remain exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than directly verifiable.\nTaken together, the lab illustrates a core theme of the course: corpus statistics and classical NLP excel at transparent, scalable description of surface patterns, while LLMs excel at contextual sense-making. These tools may be complementary when combined. The goal of the reflection that follows is to help you reason about when to use each method, how they might be combined, and what kinds of linguistic insight each can—and cannot—support.",

    "text": "Note on the Use of AI\nThis class may be part of the “tweener” generation between those that have had to learn regular expressions and practice them, and those that may use LLMs to write them.\nLLMs are very good at writing regular expressions when the intent is clear, constrained, and testable — and noticeably worse when intent is vague, underspecified, or linguistic.\nThere are lots of regexes in training data and LLMs should be very good at matching canonical patterns. But if you are the least bit unclear, you will can get a poor, but confident answer.\nMy best advise is: - Practice writing regular expressions so you are comfortable working them. You want to be able to confidently identify when there is a problem. - When you practice start with the smallest, simplest expression in a tool like https://regexr.com and then gradually build up, while visually confirming with test text that it’s doing what you want. (This is more fun than wordle.) - Get your LLM code assistant to write tests, before you get help with writing the regex. LLMs are good at writing tests, though you might not want to entirely rely on them.",

For the first few, design and test your regular expression using an online regex tester like https://regexr.com before you put them into code. Later, we’ll dispense with the code (since you’ll be comfortable with), and just focus on regular expressions themselves.\n\nExercise 1\nDesign the regex. and paste this into the test string area: Dogs bark. Cats meow. Dogs run Birds fly.\nWrite a regular expression that matches every occurence of the word Dogs.\nWhat should be matched:\n\n✅ Dogs (first occurrence)\n✅ Dogs (second occurrence)\n\nWhat should not be matched:\n\n❌ Dog\n❌ dogs (lowercase)\n❌ Dogs (with trailing space)\n❌ Any surrounding punctuation\n\nWrite down your final regex pattern. Then test it below.\n\ntext = \"Dogs bark. Cats meow. Dogs run. Birds fly.\"\nre.findall(r\"&lt;YOUR_REGEX_HERE&gt;\", text)\n\n[]\n\n\nConfirm that:\n\nThe result is a list\nThe list length matches the number of highlighted matches you saw on regexr.com\n\nIf it does, congratulations!! You are on your way to mastering regular expressions!\nWe’re going to follow the same process for the other regular expressions below. Copy the test sentence to regexr.com, then find the matches from the exercise.\n\nq1_answer = \"Type your regex here after it works\"\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nYou are practicing the + quantifier, which means “one or more of the preceding character, and introducing word boundaries (.”\nWrite a regular expression that matches each run of one or more o characters, only when they o’s occur inside a word. Confirm that each group of repeated o's is highlighted as a single match.\nWhat should be matched: - ✅ soooo → oooo - ✅ cool → oo - ✅ nooo → ooo\nWhat should not be matched\n\n❌ The letters s, c, or n\n❌ Single letters outside the repeated os\n❌ Any punctuation or spaces\n\n\ntext = \"soooo cool!!! nooo way!\"\nre.findall(r\"&lt;YOUR_REGEX_HERE&gt;\", text)\n\n[]\n\n\nConfirm that:\n\nThe result is a list\nEach list element corresponds to exactly one highlighted o sequence\nThe number of matches equals the number of highlighted regions on regexr.com\n\nIf it does, congratulations — you’ve now used quantifiers and word boundaries to precisely control what counts as a match!\n\nq2_answer = \"Type your regex here after it works\"\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nIn Exercise 2, you used word boundaries ( to control what counts as a match.\nIn this exercise, you will remove the word boundaries and observe how the matches change.\nNow write a regular expression that matches each run of one or more o characters, but do not use word boundaries.\nConfirm what is highlighted.\nWhat should be matched: - ✅ soooo → oooo - ✅ cool → oo - ✅ nooo → ooo\n(You should still see the same highlighted o sequences as before.)\nWhat should surprise you:\n\nNothing new appears in this example\nThe regex engine has less information about where words begin and end\nThe pattern now relies entirely on character repetition, not word structure\n\n\ntext = \"soooo cool!!! nooo way!\" \nre.findall(r\"&lt;YOUR_REGEX_WITHOUT_WORD_BOUNDARIES&gt;\", text)\n\n[]\n\n\n\nq3_answer = \"Type your regex here after it works\"\n\nWord boundaries don’t always change the result — but they make your intent explicit and your regex safer. Why do you think this is?\nA note on word boundaries (why they matter)\nIn the previous exercises, removing word boundaries didn’t change the result — but that was accidental.\nLet’s look at a case where word boundaries do matter.\nGo to https://regexr.com and paste the following text into the test string area:\ncar care career scared cartoon\nNow test two patterns, one at a time.\nPattern 1 (no word boundaries):\ncar\nWhat you will see highlighted:\n\ncar\ncare\ncareer\nscared\ncartoon\n\nThe regex engine is matching any occurrence of the substring car, no matter where it appears.\nPattern 2 (with word boundaries):\nhat you will see highlighted:\n\ncar (only)\n\nNow the match must:\n\nstart at a word boundary\nend at a word boundary\n\nThis tells the regex engine: “match the word car, not car as part of a larger word.”\nAll of the code blocks you just executed used regular expressions to search through our giant Tweet string. Regular expressions match substrings, not “words” or “concepts” — unless you explicitly tell them to. The basic components of regular expressions, with some examples, include:\n\nquantifiers: { . + ? * {n,m} }\noperators: { | [] () ] & -\ncharacter classes: [a-z] [0-9] \n\n\n\n\nQuantifiers\n\n\n\nregex_quantifiers\n\n\nQuantifiers tell the regex engine how many times the preceding element is allowed to match.\n\ntest_text = \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\"\n\n\n# find each character 'a' - one at a time\nprint(re.findall(r\"a\", test_text))\n\n['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']\n\n\n\n# find one or more of the character 'a'\nprint(re.findall(r\"a+\", test_text))\n\n['aaaaaaaaaaaaaa']\n\n\n\n# find one or more of the character a followed optionally by one of any character\nprint(re.findall(r\"a+.?\", test_text))\n\n['aaaaaaaaaaaaaar']\n\n\n\n# find one or more of the character 'a' followed by zero or more of any character\nprint(re.findall(r\"a+.*\", test_text))\n\n['aaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!']\n\n\n\n# find two to four of the character 'a' followed by an 'r'\nprint(re.findall(r\"a{2,4}r\", test_text))\n\n['aaaar']\n\n\nAs you can see, quantifiers are really powerful. However, with great power comes great responsibility.\n\n\n\nSample preprocessing pipeline\n\n\n\n# This greed operator matches 'bad, bad, greed' - not what we probably intended\ntest_phrase = 'You are a bad, bad, greedy operator.'\nprint(set(re.findall(r\"b.+d\", test_phrase)))\n\n{'bad, bad, greed'}\n\n\n\n# But if we convert this to a reluctant operator, it behaves much better\nprint(set(re.findall(r\"b.+?d\", test_phrase)))\n\n{'bad'}\n\n\n\n# This can seem a lot worse if you run the regex over a very large\n# string, such as our all_tweets text\n#\n# This regular expression finds the first word starting with 'ca' \n# AND the entire rest of the text that follows it, despite that \\b\n# telling it to stop at a word boundary!  Whoops!\nprint(set(re.findall(r\"\\bcar.+\\b\", all_tweets)))\n\n{'car since 1996. #clintonfakerealityshow @NaughtyBeyotch @TheRealMadman23  Don\\'t care for #Fiorina, but it seems she taking the #sexist gut punches by the #media. #MSM @FoxNews @marthamaccallum @BillHemmer whose the opportunist now, #NoHillary2016 @HillaryClinton @WomenintheWorld we need to re-establish a #global system dominated by love and affection have #moral_humane RT #Hillary is as transparent as a brick wall #LibertyNotHillary @WSJ .

It will keep matching as long as it can until it fails to finds an instance of the following element of the regex. If it cannot match once it gets to the end of the input, it will attempt to backtrack. Depending on how far it got, this can become extremely efficient. It’s usually better to try to write a more specific regular expression describing exactly what you want to match.\nNot all regular expression engines enforce this type of greediness, however, it’s best to keep in mind the following characterization of the greediness of operators.\n\n\n\nSample preprocessing pipeline\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nYou are practicing the Kleene star (*) and greedy matching.\nDesign the regex, and paste the following text into the test string area on https://regexr.com:\nI love my car, but my carbon footprint worries me.\nWrite a regular expression that matches car followed by any characters until the end of the word.\nWhat should be matched:\n\n✅ car,\n✅ carbon\n\nWhat should not be matched:\n\n❌ The word care (it does not appear here)\n❌ Anything before car\n❌ Entire sentences or multiple words\n\nOn regexpr.com, you should see the match extend as far as possible after car.\nWrite down your final regex pattern. Then test it below.\n\ntext = \"I love my car, but my carbon footprint worries me.\" \nre.findall(r\"&lt;YOUR_GREEDY_REGEX&gt;\", text)\n\n[]\n\n\n\nq4_answer = \"Type your regex here after it works\"\n\nConfirm that:\n\nThe match after car extends as far as the regex allows\nThe regex engine prefers the longest possible match\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nNow you will make the same pattern reluctant (non-greedy).\nUse the same text on https://regexr.com:\nI love my car, but my carbon footprint worries me.\nModify your regex from Exercise 1 so that it matches the shortest possible sequence after car.\nWhat should be matched:\n\n✅ car\n✅ carbon\n\n(Only the minimal necessary characters should be highlighted.)\nWhat should not be matched:\n\n❌ Long stretches of text after car\n❌ Multiple words after car\n\nOn regexr.com, you should see much shorter highlighted matches than in Exercise 1.\nWrite down your final regex pattern. Then test it below.\n\ntext = \"I love my car, but my carbon footprint worries me.\" \nre.findall(r\"&lt;YOUR_RELUCTANT_REGEX&gt;\", text)\n\n[]\n\n\n\nq5_answer = \"Type your regex here after it works\"\n\nConfirm that:\n\nThe reluctant quantifier stops matching as soon as it can\nThe greedy version matched more text than the reluctant version\n\nKey takeaway:\n\nGreedy quantifiers match as much as possible.\nReluctant quantifiers match as little as possible.\n\nBoth follow the same pattern—only the ? changes their behavior.\n\n\n\nCharacter Classes\nIn order to write a more precise pattern, you’ll need to use character classes. Regular expression languages provide the syntax necessary to do so. Some character classe come built in. Others can be constructed by the writer of the regex. We’ll take a look at both.\n\n\n\nSample preprocessing pipeline\n\n\nPractically all regex engines provide this basic set of built-in character classes. Let’s try using them in some regexes.\n\n# find all sequences of one or more digits\n# \\d is a character class for digits\nprint(set(re.findall(r\"\\d+\", all_tweets)))\n\n{'9009', '100', '724',

This seems to be the case in Python’s re* library. Later in this lab, we’ll take a look at Unicode regular expressions and how we can control matching based on the writing system we are interested in matching against. We’ll also introduce an expanded set of built-in character classes available in the regex package.\n\ninput = \"أنا أحب القراءة.  我喜欢阅读。\"\nprint(set(re.findall(r\"\\b\\w+?\\b\", input)))\n\n{'أنا', '我喜欢阅读', 'أحب', 'القراءة'}\n\n\nCharacter classes can also be defined using regular expression operators. The simplest way to describe a character class is using a range defined inside of square brackets.\n\n# find any lowercase character from a to z, one or more times\n# Note that, unlike \\w, this includes neither uppercase character nor underscores\nprint(set(re.findall(r\"\\b[a-z]+?\\b\", all_tweets)))\n\n{'blatant', 'scepter', 'exhale', 'numbered', 'coveted', 'fingilgun', 'educated',

pipeline\n\n\n\n# find a sequence of one or more characters not in the set {space, a,e,i,o,u}\n# notice that this matches numbers, punctuation and capital letters \n# (and a lot of other things not

re.IGNORECASE)))\n\nset()\n\n\nFrom now on, we’ll use the regex package, because not only does it allow for richer set definitions, but it offers more complete handling of Unicode regular expressions. You do not need to do anything regexr, because it’s PCRE compatible and has a super-set of re functionality.\n\nExercise 6\nEarlier, you saw that this pattern:\ncar.\nmatches any character after car, including letters, spaces, and punctuation.\nNow try something more controlled.\nGo to https://regexr.com and paste the following text into the test string area:\ncar care cart carb car! car?\nTest a pattern than uses character classes to meet the following conditions:\nWhat should be matched:\n\n✅ care\n✅ cart\n✅ carb\n\nWhat should not be matched:\n\n❌ car!\n❌ car?\n❌ car (with a space)\n\nYou’ve now restricted the match to cases where car is followed by a lowercase letter.\n\nq6_answer = \"Type your regex here after it works\"\n\n\n\nExercise 7\nCharacter classes can be written in different ways.\nCompare these two patterns on regexr.com with the same text text:\n\ncar[aeiou]\ncar[a-z]\n\nWhat changes:\n\ncar[aeiou] only matches words where car is followed by a vowel\ncar[a-z] matches any lowercase letter\n\nThis lets you be precise about what kind of character is allowed to appear next.\nKey takeaway\n\n. means “any character.”\nCharacter classes mean “one character from this specific set.”\n\nThis is one of the most important tools for making regexes safer and more readable.\n\n\nExercise 8\nAt first glance, [a-z] and \\w can look similar — but they mean very different things.\nGo to https://regexr.com and paste the following text into the test string area:\nword WORD word_1 café naïve 123 _hidden\nNow test a pattern that meets the following conditions:\nWhat is matched:\n\nword\n\nWhat is not matched:\n\nWORD (uppercase)\nword_1 (numbers and _)\ncafé, naïve (non-ASCII letters)\n123\n_hidden\n\nYour pattern should mean: one lowercase ASCII letter only.\n\nNow try a word boundaries pattern.\nWhat is matched:\n\nword\nWORD\nword_1\n123\n_hidden\n\nWhat may surprise you:\n\nDepending on the regex engine and flags, accented characters like é may not be included\n_ (underscore) is considered a “word character”\n\nThis pattern means: letters, digits, and underscore — not “linguistic word.”\n\n\n\nLogical Operators\nThe set notation we’ve just looked at reveals another useful tool for defining patterns. Logical operators allow you to to express Boolean logic with the operators AND, OR and NOT.\n\n\n\nSample preprocessing pipeline\n\n\nLet’s get a little more practice using logical operators.\n\n# Find all the a or z characters \nprint(re.findall(r\"(a|z)\", all_tweets))\n\n['z', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'z', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a',

'\\\\', ']', '^', '_', '|', '~']\n\n\nNotice that we introduced a third argument into the call to findall(). The behavior of the regex matcher can be controlled using predefined flags, that you can pass it. The flags available for use in the regex package are described at its PyPI site. The flags can be combined together with a vertical bar (i.e. they can be OR’ed together). In the follwing regular expression, regex.DOTALL tells the regex engine that the dot is allowed to match the newline character, ‘’, and regex.IGNORECASE asks the engine to ignore orthographic case.\n\nsearch_me = 'I like the red and\\nThe blue and the green AND THE PURPLE!'\npattern = regex.compile(r\"d.t\",regex.DOTALL|regex.IGNORECASE)\nprint(regex.findall(pattern, search_me ))\n\n['d\\nT', 'd t', 'D T']\n\n\n\nExercise 9\nRegular expressions support simple logical operations that let you say:\n\nOR: match this or that\nNOT: match anything except these characters\n\nThese operators let you widen or restrict matches without writing multiple regexes.\n\nThe OR operator is written using a vertical bar:\npattern1|pattern2\nThis means: match pattern1 OR match pattern2.\nGo to https://regexr.com and paste the following text into the test string area:\nI drive a car. She rides a bike. They take the bus.\nTest a pattern that meets the following conditions:\n\nWhat should be matched:\n\n✅ car\n✅ bike\n\n\nWhat should not be matched:\n\n❌ bus\n❌ Any surrounding punctuation or spaces\n\nOn regexr.com, you should see only the words car and bike highlighted, wherever they appear.\n\nKey idea:\n\nOR combines entire patterns, not individual characters.\n\n\nA negated character class lets you say “match any character except these.”\nNegation is written by placing ^ inside square brackets:\n[^abc]\nThis matches any single character that is NOT a, b, or c.\nGo to https://regexpr.com and paste this text into the test string area:\ncar cab cap cat\nNow test this pattern:\nca[^bpt]\n\nWhat should be matched:\n\n✅ car\n\n\nWhat should not be matched:\n\n❌ cab\n❌ cap\n❌ cat\n\nThe pattern means: - ca - followed by one character - that is not b, p, or t\n\nImportant distinction\n\n^ inside [] means NOT\n^ outside [] means start of string (you’ll see this later)\n\nContext matters.\n\nKey takeaway\n\n| lets you express alternatives.\n[^ ] lets you express exclusion.\n\nTogether, these operators let you control what is allowed and what is forbidden in a match.\n\n\nExercise 10\nA negated character class lets you say:\n\n“Match any character except these.”\n\nNegation is written by placing ^ inside square brackets.\n[^abc]\nThis matches any single character that is not a, b, or c.\n\nGo to https://regexr.com and paste the following text into the test string area:\ncar cab cap cat\nNow test a pattern with negation:\nWhat is matched:\n\n✅ car\n\n\nWhat is not matched:\n\n❌ cab\n❌ cap\n❌ cat\n\n\nHow to read this pattern:\n\nca\n\nfollowed by one character\n\nthat is not b, p, or t\n\n\nImportant distinction:\n\n^ inside [] → NOT\n^ outside [] → start of string\n\nSame symbol, different meaning depending on position.\n\n\n\nBoundary characters and anchors\nNow let’s move on to another useful piece of regex syntax: boundaries and anchors.\n\n\n\nSample preprocessing pipeline\n\n\nBoundary characters are very convenient character classes that let you control where in your input text a match is allowed to occur. Imagine that you want to convert uppercase letters to lowercase, but only at the beginning of a line.\n\n# replace capital T at the beginning of a line with lowercase t\n# but don't replace it anywhere else, please\n\nthisthis = \"This is This and that is that!\"\nresult = regex.sub(r\"^T\",\"t\", thisthis)\nprint(result)\n\nthis is This and that is that!\n\n\nNote: Don’t confuse the ^ anchor character that is the beginning of the string boundary character with the ^ not operator. The not operator occurs inside of the square brackets used to define character classes, e.g. [^aeiou] means a character that is not in the set [aeiou].\n\n\n\nSample preprocessing pipeline\n\n\n\n# print whatever character is after each word boundary '\\b'\nprint(regex.findall(r\"\\b(.)\", \"&lt;noun&gt;big_fish_42&lt;/noun&gt;\"))\n\n['n', '&gt;', 'b', '&lt;', 'n', '&gt;']\n\n\n\n\nMatch groups\nAnother useful aspect of regular expressions is the ability to define groups and to access them, both from within the regex application, e.g. as part of escape functions, and also from your code after the regex has found its matches.\n\n\n\nSample preprocessing pipeline\n\n\n\n# find any non-space character, then find the same character one or more times\n# this lets you find repeated characters! Aaaah!  SOoooooo cooOOOool! &lt;-- better ignore\n# case if you want to find that\nprint(set(regex.findall(r\"(([^\\s])\\2+)\", all_tweets )))\n\n{('......', '.'), ('$$$', '$'), ('666', '6'), ('yyy', 'y'), ('HH', 'H'), ('999', '9'), ('dd', 'd'), ('LL', 'L'), ('ii', 'i'), ('aa', 'a'), ('00000', '0'), ('DD', 'D'), ('OO', 'O'), ('xxx', 'x'), ('FFF', 'F'), ('YY', 'Y'), ('AAA', 'A'), ('eee', 'e'), (\"''\", \"'\"), ('CC', 'C'), ('^^', '^'), ('ww', 'w'), ('AA', 'A'), ('lll', 'l'), ('00', '0'), ('ff', 'f'), ('111', '1'), ('hh', 'h'), ('OOOO', 'O'), ('_____', '_'), ('!!', '!'), ('bb', 'b'), ('kk', 'k'), ('gg', 'g'), ('11', '1'), ('nn', 'n'), ('ooo', 'o'), ('XX', 'X'), ('EEEEEEEEEEE', 'E'), ('???', '?'), ('BB', 'B'), ('??', '?'), ('CCC', 'C'), ('000', '0'), ('!!!!!!', '!'), ('___', '_'), ('FF', 'F'), ('MMM', 'M'), ('NNN', 'N'), ('MM', 'M'), ('hhh', 'h'), ('aaa', 'a'), ('mmm', 'm'), ('77', '7'), ('____', '_'), ('99', '9'), ('))))', ')'), ('AAAAA', 'A'), ('RR', 'R'), ('....', '.'), ('!!!', '!'), ('22', '2'), ('cc', 'c'), ('mmmm', 'm'), ('tt', 't'), ('..', '.'), ('NN', 'N'), ('hhhh', 'h'), ('uuu', 'u'), ('44', '4'), ('55', '5'), ('ccc', 'c'), ('EE', 'E'), ('ooooo', 'o'), ('jj', 'j'), ('TT', 'T'), ('~~', '~'), ('--', '-'), ('aaaa', 'a'), ('$$', '$'), ('88', '8'), ('...', '.'), ('ppp', 'p'), ('__', '_'), ('II', 'I'), ('uuuu', 'u'), ('66', '6'), ('mm', 'm'), ('yy', 'y'), ('GGG', 'G'), ('!!!!!!!', '!'), ('xx', 'x'), ('33', '3'), ('.....', '.'), ('SS', 'S'), ('uu', 'u'), ('aaaaaa', 'a'), ('JJ', 'J'), ('????', '?'), ('333', '3'), ('uuuuuuuuuuu', 'u'), ('vv', 'v'), ('yyyyyyyyyy', 'y'), ('888', '8'), ('GG', 'G'), ('zzzzzzzzzzzzzz', 'z'), ('oo', 'o'), ('ee', 'e'), ('rrrr', 'r'), ('hhhhh', 'h'), ('ss', 's'), ('pp', 'p'), ('PP', 'P'), ('rrr', 'r'), ('zz', 'z'), ('##', '#'), ('rr', 'r'), ('!!!!', '!'), ('WW', 'W'), ('ll', 'l')}\n\n\nNotice that in the cool repeated character sample above, you get a set of tuples. That is because in this case the regex engine is giving you match-group one and match-group two, which are, again, numbered from left to right by the location of the parentheses.\nNow let’s see how we can use the back-reference in a replacement function.\n\ntest_silliness = \"aaaAAAAaaah!  sweeEEeeet!  ooOOOoh!\"\nprint(\"before: \",test_silliness)\n\n# find a vowel, then one or more of whichever vowel you found, and replace it with\n# just two of that vowel\npattern = regex.compile(r\"([aeiou])(\\1+)\", regex.IGNORECASE)\ndown_to_two = regex.sub(pattern,r\"\\1\\1\", test_silliness)\nprint(\"after: \",down_to_two)\n\nbefore:  aaaAAAAaaah!  sweeEEeeet!  ooOOOoh!\nafter:  aah!  sweet!  ooh!\n\n\nIn this sweet example, we converted our duplicate character sequences into \\1\\1, meaning two of whichever character we matched. That is to avoid ruining words with two legitimate vowel sequences, such as ‘sweet’!\nAnother interesting use of match groups is to find just the piece or pieces that you want from within a lager match. In this example, the the the set of all matches is returned as an array of tuples, where the tuples represent the ordered set of match groups.\n\n# write a regular expression to find the two sides of an equation\nmath_thoughts = \"The answer to 1+1=2 is too easy. Let's try 5+5=10\"\nmath_pattern = regex.compile(r\"(\\d+[+-]\\d)=(\\d+)\")\nequations = regex.findall(math_pattern, math_thoughts)\n\nprint(equations)\nprint(\"The answer to \",equations[0][0],\" is:  \",equations[0][1])\n\n[('1+1', '2'), ('5+5', '10')]\nThe answer to  1+1  is:   2\n\n\n\n\nEscaping special characters\nThis example brings us to another feature of regular expression languages. The fact that there are special, reserved characters that serve as operators and quantifiers means that there also needs to be a mechanism for matching those same characters in your text via a pattern. The way to do that is by escaping them. In regex, that mainly means preceding them with a backslash.\n\n\n\nSample preprocessing pipeline\n\n\n\n\n\nSample preprocessing pipeline\n\n\n\n\n\nSample preprocessing pipeline\n\n\n\n# let's just prove that to ourselves\ntest_noescape = \"will it find 1+2 pr 111111112?\"\nprint(regex.findall(r\"1+2\", test_noescape))\n\n['111111112']\n\n\n\nprint(regex.findall(r\"1\\+2\", test_noescape))\n\n['1+2']\n\n\n\n\nNon-capturing groups\nNow, returning for a moment to the the question of match groups, what if you wanted to create a group that didn’t form a match? For example, if you needed a quantifier such as the kleene star to apply to a group, but you didn’t want it to form a group in the match object? In this case, there is another special piece of syntax for non-grouping groups (yes, really): (?:blah).\n\nfloat_thoughts = \"The answer to 1.10+1.00=2.10 is too easy. Let's try 5.6+5.3=10.9\"\n\n# find the two sides of an equation involving floats\nfloat_pattern_too_many_groups = regex.compile(r\"(\\d+(\\.\\d+)*[+-]\\d(\\.\\d+)*)=(\\d+(\\.\\d+)*)\")\nequations = regex.findall(float_pattern_too_many_groups, float_thoughts)\n\nprint(equations)\nprint(\"The answer to \",equations[0][0],\" is:  \",equations[0][1])\nprint(\"\\n That's too many match groups for my liking,\\n let's try again with non-grouping groups for the decimal places:\\n\")\nfloat_pattern_too_many_groups = regex.compile(r\"(\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?[+-]\\d(?:\\.\\d+)?)=(\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?)\")\nequations = regex.findall(float_pattern_too_many_groups, float_thoughts)\nprint(equations)\nprint(\"The answer to \",equations[0][0],\" is:  \",equations[0][1])\n\n[('1.10+1.00', '.10', '.00', '2.10', '.10'), ('5.6+5.3', '.6', '.3', '10.9', '.9')]\nThe answer to  1.10+1.00  is:   .10\n\n That's too many match groups for my liking,\n let's try again with non-grouping groups for the decimal places:\n\n[('1.10+1.00', '2.10'), ('5.6+5.3', '10.9')]\nThe answer to  1.10+1.00  is:   2.10\n\n\nSo, putting the ?: after the opening paren (?: ) to add the non-grouping sub-expression (?:.)? allows you to make the decimal point followed by one or more digits optional as a group, without causing that group to be added to the match results. The official term for this is a non-capturing group.\n\n\nLookahead and lookbehind\nAnother way of grouping elements is include lookahead or lookbehind assertions. These types of non-capturing groups neither cause groups to be output as part of the match, nor do they “consume” the input text, meaning that the text is still available for matching against subsequent portions of the regex.\nExamples will help illustrate this.\n\na_string = \"an artist a1 a$\"\n\n# match a, but only if you find a letter from a-z when you look ahead, \n# but don't include that letter in the match\nprint(\"positive lookahead after a: \",regex.findall(r\"(a(?=[a-z]))\", a_string))\n\n# match a, but only if you find a letter from a-z after it\n# and include that letter in the match, but don't make a group for it\nprint(\"non-capturing group after a:\",regex.findall(r\"(a(?:[a-z]))\", a_string))\n      \n# match a, but only if you find a letter from a-z after it\n# and include that letter in the match, and make a group for the second letter     \nprint(\"regular group after a:\",regex.findall(r\"(a([a-z]))\", a_string))\n\npositive lookahead after a:  ['a', 'a']\nnon-capturing group after a: ['an', 'ar']\nregular group after a: [('an', 'n'), ('ar', 'r')]\n\n\nThree related concepts are positive lookbehind, negative lookahead, and negative lookbehind. Think about how those might be similar to and/or different from positive lookahead.\n\n\nUnicode regexes\nNow that you have had an overview of the basic syntax of regular expressions, let’s take a peek at some more modern aspects of regular expressions that are designed to take advantage of Unicode properties, which are described in great detail at https://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html (the source of the following image):\n\n\n\nunicode character classes\n\n\nEspecially exciting for multilingual computing is the availability of character classes for recognizing different writing systems.\n\n\n\nunicode blocks\n\n\nClickable sources of information about Unicode properties: https://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html and Richard Ishida’s Uniview tool\n\n# find the set of all punctuation sequences in the all_tweets text\npunct_sequences = set(regex.findall(r\"\\p{Punct}+\", all_tweets))\nprint(sorted(punct_sequences, key=len))\n\n['-', '*', \"'\", ';', '_', '\"', ',', ':', '?', ')', '\\\\', '.', '#', '!', '/', ']', '%', '@', '(', '&', '[', '?!', ',&', '\".', ',\"', '?\"', '])', '\"?', '/#', '([', '.!', '!\"', '-@', '##', '.-', '-#', '@_', '(#', \"',\", ').', ',@', '\"-', '__', \"'-\", '.(', \"''\", '.*', '??', ':#', ');', '!)', '!?', '--', '.#', ':(', \"'.\", ':)', '-,', '\":', '!!', '(@', '!-', '.\"', '/@', ',#', '.@', ';)', ';\"', \".'\", '.)', '%!', '\"@', '],', '..', '),', '):', '_:', '\"#', '?-', '...', '???', '!!\"', '].\"', '?..', '!!!', '___', '..#', \".''\", '.\"\\\\', '-_-', '@__', '--@', '..?', '].#', ';--', ';-)', ':-)', '!!!!', '...?', '...\"', '!?..', '.../', '!!!-', '....', \"'...\", '\"...', '____', '?...', '????', '!?!!', '..!!', '#...', '.....', '....#', '_____', '!!!!?', \"',...\", '?!?!?', '!!!!!!', '......', ':-))))', '.....#', '!!!!!!!', ')!!.....', '?!!??!????']",

The formula \\(-\\log_2 P(w)\\) is the theoretical minimum — you literally cannot do better.\n\nCommon words like “the” (high probability) → few bits → short codes\nRare words like “quixotic” (low probability) → more bits → longer codes\nUnseen words (zero probability) → infinite bits → impossible to encode\n\nThis is why probability models matter for compression: your probability estimates directly determine your code lengths.\n\n\nThe Catastrophe: Zero Probability\nNow we see the problem: when \\(P = 0\\), we get \\(-\\log_2(0) = \\infty\\) bits.\nThe encoder literally cannot proceed. Arithmetic coding works by subdividing the number line according to symbol probabilities. A zero-probability symbol gets zero space — there’s nowhere to put it.

    "text": "8. Why Good–Turing and Backoff Exist\nLaplace smoothing has problems at scale. Real systems use smarter techniques:\nBackoff: If we haven’t seen a bigram, fall back to the unigram probability. Only use the lower-order model when the higher-order one has no data.\n\\[P(w_i | w_{i-1}) = \\begin{cases} P_{\\text{bigram}}(w_i | w_{i-1}) & \\text{if count}(w_{i-1}, w_i) &gt; 0 \\\\ \\alpha \\cdot P_{\\text{unigram}}(w_i) & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\]\nInterpolation: Instead of choosing one or the other, blend all n-gram levels together:\n\\[P(w_i | w_{i-1}) = \\lambda_1 \\cdot P_{\\text{bigram}}(w_i | w_{i-1}) + \\lambda_2 \\cdot P_{\\text{unigram}}(w_i)\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 1\\). This way, even seen bigrams get some influence from unigram statistics.\nDiscounting: Instead of adding counts (like Laplace), subtract a small amount from observed counts and redistribute that probability mass to unseen events. Good–Turing estimates how much to discount based on how many things occurred exactly once, twice, etc.\n\\[P_{\\text{discounted}}(w) = \\frac{\\text{count}(w) - d}{N}\\]\n(Jurafsky & Martin chapter 3 covers these in detail.)\n\nThe Problem with Laplace Smoothing at Scale\nImagine a vocabulary of \\(V = 50{,}000\\) words: - Possible bigrams: \\(V^2 = 2.5\\) billion - Possible trigrams: \\(V^3 = 125\\) trillion\nLaplace smoothing adds 1 to all of these — even absurd combinations like “the the the” or “banana quantum fishbowl.” We’re wasting probability mass on events that will never occur.\nBut there’s a subtler problem: what probability should we use when backing off?\n\n\nThe “San Francisco” Problem: Why Context Matters for Backoff\nConsider these two words in a large corpus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord\nRaw Count\nContexts It Follows\n\n\n\n\nFrancisco\n5,000\n“San” (4,990), “Pope” (10)\n\n\nTuesday\n5,000\n“last”, “next”, “every”, “on”, “until”, … (hundreds)\n\n\n\nBoth words appear 5,000 times. But look at their contexts: - “Francisco” almost only follows “San” — it’s trapped in one bigram - “Tuesday” follows hundreds of different words — it’s versatile\nNow imagine we need to back off:\nWe encounter a novel bigram like “I visited Francisco” — we’ve never seen “visited Francisco” in training. We need to estimate P(Francisco | visited) by backing off to some unigram-like probability.\nThe problem with raw frequency: If we use raw counts, P(Francisco) ≈ P(Tuesday). But intuitively, “I visited Tuesday” makes more sense than “I visited Francisco” (without “San”).\nKneser-Ney’s insight: Instead of raw frequency, count how many different contexts a word appears in (its continuation count):\n\\[P_{\\text{continuation}}(w) = \\frac{|\\{v : \\text{count}(v, w) &gt; 0\\}|}{|\\text{all bigram types}|}\\]\n\n“Francisco”: appears after ~2 distinct words → low continuation probability\n“Tuesday”: appears after ~500 distinct words → high continuation probability\n\nThis is why Kneser-Ney outperforms Laplace: when backing off, it asks “how versatile is this word?” not “how frequent is this word?”",

    "text": "Load Libraries and Models\nBefore we can work with spaCy, we need to import the necessary libraries. Think of this as gathering your tools before starting a project.\n\n# If you are colab, un-comment the pip install below.\n# This will not be necessary on DeepNote or your local installation\n\n#!pip install data401_nlp\n\n\n# Environment (must run first)\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\nimport data401_nlp\nprint(data401_nlp.__version__)\n\n# Core libs\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# ML libs\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# NLP libs\nimport spacy\nimport nltk\n\n# Tools libs\nimport json\nimport fastcore.tools as fc\nimport orjson\n\n0.0.7\n\n\n\n# This checks to make sure your SUBMIT_API_KEY is present\n# It can take a moment to load... run again if it fails the first time\n\nprint(\"SUBMIT_API_KEY present:\", bool(os.getenv(\"SUBMIT_API_KEY\")))\n\nDetected environment: dotenv\nSUBMIT_API_KEY present: True\n\n\n\nLoading a spaCy Language Model\nSpaCy does not analyze text on its own. It needs a language model—a pre-trained set of rules and patterns for a specific language. We are using en_core_web_sm, a small English model optimized for CPU processing. The “sm” stands for “small,” meaning it downloads quickly and runs fast, though larger models exist for more demanding applications.\nWhen you visit the model documentation, you will find details about what text it was trained on, what components it includes, and how accurate it is. We will explore most of these components over the coming weeks.\n\n# load spacy\n# This helper ensures it will automatically download if not present\n\nfrom data401_nlp.helpers.spacy import ensure_spacy_model\n\ndef get_nlp():\n    return ensure_spacy_model(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n\n\nSetting Up LLM Access\nLater in this notebook, we will compare traditional NLP methods with LLM-based approaches. The code below sets up access to an LLM through our helper functions. Do not worry about the details here—just know that this gives us a way to ask questions to an AI model like Claude or GPT.\nYour model is currently set to Claude, though you can change it to OpenAI by modifying LLM_MODELS[0] to LLM_MODELS[1]. It is easy to extend the helper to accommodate others and send a pull request to me, if you use a different model that you’d like added.\n\nfrom data401_nlp.helpers.env import load_env\nfrom data401_nlp.helpers.llm import make_chat, LLM_MODELS\n\nload_env()\nDEFAULT_MODEL = LLM_MODELS[0] # Assumes Claude key... adjust if needed.\nprint(\"Selected model:\", DEFAULT_MODEL)\nchat = make_chat(DEFAULT_MODEL)\n\nSelected model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\n\n\n\n# You must explicitly opt in, if you want to use and run cells with external LLM calls\nENABLE_LLM = False\n\n\ndef llm_status(chat_fn):\n    if not ENABLE_LLM:\n        return \"disabled\"\n    try:\n        chat_fn(\"ping\", max_tokens=1)\n        return \"ready\"\n    except Exception:\n        return \"misconfigured\"\n\nprint(\"LLM status:\", llm_status(chat))\n\nLLM status: disabled\n\n\n\ndef make_and_test_chat(model_name):\n    if not ENABLE_LLM:\n        return None  # silent no-op\n\n    try:\n        chat = make_chat(model_name)\n        chat(\"ping\", max_tokens=1)\n        return chat\n    except Exception:\n        return None  # silent fail\n\n\ndef llm_available():\n    return ENABLE_LLM and chat is not None\n\nThe listette library wraps the litellm library and makes it possible for us to add models with API keys to this notebook. I’ve included it in helper functions behind the scenes.\nYou don’t need a subscription or API access, if you don’t have it already. Use these notebooks as “read-only” for those sections. But if you do have a key, do use it!\n\nUse Colab or Deepnote’s Secrets feature (recommended) - store keys in Colab’s built-in secrets manager\nSet environment variables manually in your notebook\nUse a .env file in your local environment",

    "section": "Part A: Exploring the SpaCy Pipeline (Tokens, POS, NER, and Parse Trees)",
    "text": "Part A: Exploring the SpaCy Pipeline (Tokens, POS, NER, and Parse Trees)\nIn this section, you will learn how spaCy transforms raw text into structured data. This is the foundation of all NLP work: taking unstructured text and adding labels, categories, and relationships that computers can work with.\n\nThe Doc Object: Your Container for Processed Text\nA Doc object is a smart container for data. When you give text to spaCy, it returns a Doc containing your original text plus all the analysis spaCy performs. Every word gets labeled, entities get identified, and grammatical relationships get mapped out—all stored in this single object.\nThe nlp object is what does the work. When you call nlp(text), spaCy runs your text through a series of processing steps called a pipeline. Each step adds different information: one step breaks text into words, another identifies parts of speech, another finds named entities, and so on.\nIn practice, you create one Doc per document. An Amazon review would be one Doc. A news article would be one Doc. This organization helps when you are processing many documents at once.\nThe image below captures a high-level overview of the spaCy API. Here you can see that text is processed by the nlp pipeline which runs the tokenizer. The Doc object itself has Token and Span objects. Let’s look at tokens below. (We’ll hold off on spans till we have a use for them.)\n\n\n# Sample text with multiple entities and interesting linguistic features\nsample_text = \"\"\"Dr. Sarah Chen joined Anthropic in San Francisco on January 15, 2024. She previously worked at Google Brain, where she led a team developing language models that could process over 100,000 tokens per second.\"\"\"\n\n# Process with spaCy\n# We're going to call nlp inside a function so that we don't rely on a global nlp object\n# for demos\n\nnlp = get_nlp()  \ndoc = nlp(sample_text)\ndoc\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n\n\nDr. Sarah Chen joined Anthropic in San Francisco on January 15, 2024. She previously worked at Google Brain, where she led a team developing language models that could process over 100,000 tokens per second.\n\n\n\n[word.text for word in doc]\n\n['Dr.',\n 'Sarah',\n 'Chen',\n 'joined',\n 'Anthropic',\n 'in',\n 'San',\n 'Francisco',\n 'on',\n 'January',\n '15',\n ',',\n '2024',\n '.',\n 'She',\n 'previously',\n 'worked',\n 'at',\n 'Google',\n 'Brain',\n ',',\n 'where',\n 'she',\n 'led',\n 'a',\n 'team',\n 'developing',\n 'language',\n 'models',\n 'that',\n 'could',\n 'process',\n 'over',\n '100,000',\n 'tokens',\n 'per',\n 'second',\n '.']\n\n\nNotice how spaCy split the text into individual pieces. “Dr.” stays together as one piece. “San Francisco” becomes two separate pieces. Punctuation marks like commas and periods each become their own piece. This process of splitting text into pieces is called tokenization, and each piece is called a token.\n\n\nTokens and Their Attributes\nA token is the basic unit of text in NLP. At its simplest, a token is just a piece of text that has been assigned a number (so computers can work with it). But in spaCy, tokens carry much more: part-of-speech labels, grammatical relationships, and other linguistic information.\nWe will spend significant time on tokenization in the coming weeks because how you split text dramatically affects NLP performance. Tokenization has enormous impact on the performance on NLP tasks.\nFor now, just understand that tokens are the building blocks we work with.\nEach token has many attributes—pieces of information attached to it. The spaCy token documentation lists all available attributes, or you can use Python’s help function:\n\n# At this point, it can be helpful to look at API documentation. \n# This is one way to do it. Uncomment the line below line.\n\n# help(doc[0])\n\n\nfor token in doc:\n    print(token.text, token.dep_, token.head.text, token.head.pos_,\n            [child for child in token.children])\n\nDr. compound Chen PROPN []\nSarah compound Chen PROPN []\nChen nsubj joined VERB [Dr., Sarah]\njoined ROOT joined VERB [Chen, Anthropic, in, on, .]\nAnthropic dobj joined VERB []\nin prep joined VERB [Francisco]\nSan compound Francisco PROPN []\nFrancisco pobj in ADP [San]\non prep joined VERB [January]\nJanuary pobj on ADP [15, ,, 2024]\n15 nummod January PROPN []\n, punct January PROPN []\n2024 nummod January PROPN []\n. punct joined VERB []\nShe nsubj worked VERB []\npreviously advmod worked VERB []\nworked ROOT worked VERB [She, previously, at, .]\nat prep worked VERB [Brain]\nGoogle compound Brain PROPN []\nBrain pobj at ADP [Google, ,, led]\n, punct Brain PROPN []\nwhere advmod led VERB []\nshe nsubj led VERB []\nled relcl Brain PROPN [where, she, team]\na det team NOUN []\nteam dobj led VERB [a, developing]\ndeveloping acl team NOUN [models]\nlanguage compound models NOUN []\nmodels dobj developing VERB [language, process]\nthat nsubj process VERB []\ncould aux process VERB []\nprocess relcl models NOUN [that, could, tokens]\nover quantmod 100,000 NUM []\n100,000 nummod tokens NOUN [over]\ntokens dobj process VERB [100,000, per]\nper prep tokens NOUN [second]\nsecond pobj per ADP []\n. punct worked VERB []\n\n\nThis output is dense! Do not worry about understanding every detail. The key insight is that each token carries information about its grammatical role (dep_), what word it relates to (head), and what words depend on it (children). We will explore these relationships more in the dependency parsing section.\nLet us view this information in a cleaner format using a pandas DataFrame, and add a few more commonly used attributes:\n\ntoken_data = []\nfor token in doc:\n    token_data.append({\n        \"Token\": token.text,\n        \"Lemma\": token.lemma_,\n        \"Lower\": token.lower_,\n        \"Shape\": token.shape_,\n        \"POS\": token.pos_,\n        \"Tag\": token.tag_,\n        \"Dep\": token.dep_,\n        \"Is_Stop\": token.is_stop,\n        \"Is_Punct\": token.is_punct,\n        \"Is_Digit\": token.is_digit,\n        \"Is_Alpha\": token.is_alpha\n    })\n\ntoken_df = pd.DataFrame(token_data)\nprint(token_df.head(15).to_string(index=False))\n\n    Token     Lemma     Lower Shape   POS Tag      Dep  Is_Stop  Is_Punct  Is_Digit  Is_Alpha\n      Dr.       Dr.       dr.

A token is simply a piece of text that can be represented as an integer. The first stage in a spaCy pipeline is tokenization to break up text into the smaller bits that we process. As objects, they have the potential to carry a lot of information. We’re going to briefly look at the sorts of information they carry in this lab. Don’t worry about the details… this is an introduction to terms you will become more familiar with.\nNow let’s look at each type of annotation! What are they, and what might we do with them.\n\n\nLemmas and Stopwords\nTwo of the most useful token attributes are lemmas and stopword flags. Understanding these will help you see why preprocessing matters in NLP.\nLemmas are the base or dictionary form of a word. For example: - “joined” → “join” - “running” → “run”\n- “better” → “good”\nThis normalization is useful because it lets you treat different forms of the same word as equivalent. For instance, if you’re analyzing sentiment in reviews, you’d want “loved,” “loving,” and “loves” to all be recognized as the same concept.\nStop words are common words that often don’t carry much meaning on their own, like “the,” “is,” “at,” “in,” “a.” You can see in your token table that words like “in” and “on” are marked as stop words.\nThey’re often filtered out in tasks like: - Document classification (where “the” appears everywhere and doesn’t help distinguish topics) - Keyword extraction (you want meaningful words, not “and” or “of”)\nHowever, stop words ARE very important for some tasks—like machine translation or question answering, where “not” or “who” can completely change meaning!\nLooking at your sample text, can you spot why lemmatization might be helpful for analyzing this text? What if you wanted to count how many times people “work” at different companies across many documents?\n\n\nPart-of-Speech Tagging\nPart-of-speech (POS) tagging assigns grammatical categories to each word. Is “book” a noun (I read a book) or a verb (I will book a flight)? POS tags help answer this question based on context.\nSpaCy uses two types of POS tags:\n\nCoarse-grained tags (token.pos_) - Universal POS tags from the Universal Dependencies project. These are standardized across languages (like NOUN, VERB, ADJ, etc.)\nFine-grained tags (token.tag_) - Language-specific tags. For English, these are Penn Treebank tags (like NNP, VBD, JJ, etc.)\n\nThe best references are:\n\nUniversal POS tags\nPenn Treebank tags\nSpaCy’s own documentation\n\nYou can also see what tags are available in your loaded model by checking nlp.get_pipe(\"tagger\").labels.\nHere’s a quick reference for the tags appearing in our token data above:\nPOS Tags (Universal): - PROPN - Proper noun (Sarah, Chen, Anthropic, San Francisco) - VERB - Verb (joined) - ADP - Adposition/preposition (in, on) - NUM - Number (15, 2024) - PUNCT - Punctuation (., ,) - PRON - Pronoun (She)\nPenn Treebank Tags (detailed): - NNP - Proper noun, singular (Dr., Sarah, Chen) - VBD - Verb, past tense (joined) - IN - Preposition or subordinating conjunction (in, on) - CD - Cardinal number (15, 2024) - PRP - Personal pronoun (She)\nDependency Labels: - nsubj - Nominal subject (Chen is the subject of “joined”) - dobj - Direct object (Anthropic is what was joined) - compound - Compound modifier (Dr. + Sarah + Chen) - prep - Prepositional modifier (in, on) - pobj - Object of preposition (Francisco, January) - nummod - Numeric modifier (15 modifies January) - ROOT - Root of the sentence (joined)\nSpaCy’s POS tagger uses a neural network model trained on annotated text data. Here’s how it works:\nTraining: The model learns patterns from large corpora (like OntoNotes for English) where words are already tagged with their parts of speech. It learns contextual clues—for example, that a word after “the” is likely a noun.\nPrediction: When you process text with nlp(text), the tagger looks at each token in context (surrounding words, word shape, prefixes/suffixes) and predicts the most likely POS tag using the trained neural network.\nArchitecture: Modern SpaCy models (v3+) use transformer-based or CNN-based architectures. The small model you’re using (en_core_web_sm) uses a more compact architecture for speed.\nThe tagger is one component in the processing pipeline. You can see your pipeline components with:\n\nnlp = get_nlp()\nnlp.pipe_names\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n\n\n['tok2vec', 'tagger', 'parser', 'attribute_ruler', 'lemmatizer', 'ner']\n\n\nThis shows the six processing steps that run when you call nlp(text):\n\ntok2vec - Converts tokens into numerical vectors (we will cover this later)\ntagger - Assigns POS tags\nparser - Analyzes grammatical structure (dependency parsing)\nattribute_ruler - Applies rule-based attribute assignments\nlemmatizer - Computes lemmas (base forms of words)\nner - Named Entity Recognition\n\nNotice that tok2vec comes first. It creates vector representations that other components (like the tagger and parser) use as input. This shared representation is one of spaCy’s clever design features—multiple components benefit from the same underlying analysis.\nAs you will inuit over time, even if we didn’t use spaCy, we would need an nlp pipeline. In general terms, an NLP pipeline is a sequence of processing steps that transform raw text into increasingly structured representations, where each step adds or refines information that later steps can use.\nConceptually:\n\nInput starts as unstructured text\nEach component performs a specific analysis (e.g., tokenization, tagging, parsing)\nThe output is a layered annotation of the same text, not a replacement\nLater components can depend on the results of earlier ones\n\nThe key idea is modularity: complex language understanding is built by composing simple, specialized stages rather than solving everything at once. As we will see later, we can add new components to this pipeline… which makes it possible for us to create hybrid NLP solutions using traditional ML with representation and generative models!\nBelow is a visual depiction of a spaCy pipeline.\n\nWe’ve looked a bit at tokenization, lemmas, and part of speech - let’s move on to NER.\n\n\nNamed Entities\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) identifies and classifies real-world objects in text: people, organizations, locations, dates, and more. This is one of the most practically useful NLP tasks—imagine automatically extracting all company names from thousands of news articles.\nAccording to the SpaCy model reference, the NER component also uses vectors as input. It is configurable to use its own Tok2Vec model, though by default, uses the pipeline Tok2Vec model. SpaCy is extremely configurable and you can turn components on and off, as long as you are paying attention to dependencies.\nNER uses all sorts of features as context. For example, it uses punctuation to signal clause boundaries, abbreviations, etc. It also uses lexical features and contextual token features such as neighboring tokens, subword patterns, and other contextual clues. It does not rely on POS tags or dependency parses.\n\n# Visualize entities (Colab-friendly)\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom IPython.display import display, HTML\n\n# Render entities\nhtml = displacy.render(doc, style=\"ent\", jupyter=False)\ndisplay(HTML(html))\n\nDr. \n\n    Sarah Chen\n    PERSON\n\n joined Anthropic in \n\n    San Francisco\n    GPE\n\n on \n\n    January 15, 2024\n    DATE\n\n.

Information Extraction - You can filter for specific patterns.

Disambiguation - The word “book” could be a noun (read a book) or verb (book a flight). POS tags help distinguish meaning.\n4. Feature Engineering - For classification tasks, POS tag distributions can be features.

    "section": "Part B: Dependency Parsing",
    "text": "Part B: Dependency Parsing\nSo far, we have looked at individual tokens in isolation. But language is about relationships—subjects perform actions on objects, adjectives modify nouns, prepositions connect phrases. Dependency parsing captures these relationships by connecting each word to the word it depends on.\nYou have been given some basic study material on a theory of language structure based on “X-bar” theory, which is the theory behind constituent parsing. This kind of parsing has a lot of positives. It can tell you about where noun and verb phrases begin and end because it has rich, hierarchical structure. You can plugin a constituent parser into spaCy, but it’s not the default.\nSpaCy chose to implement dependency parsing because it’s faster (linear time), low memory, robust token-centric, and works across many languages (i.e. cross-lingual). Like constituent parsing, it’s also usedful for downstream tasks. Your linguistics book doesn’t talk about dependency parsing, so we’ll draw from Jurafsky and Martin and touch on it in this notebook.\nNote, it’s not important to know the details here. Focus on why SpaCy has a dependency parser out of the box – why it might be useful – and that it works at the token level.\n\n# Visualize entities (Colab-friendly)\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom IPython.display import display, HTML\n\noptions = {\n    \"distance\": 90,   # arc length\n    \"compact\": False,\n    \"bg\": \"#ffffff\",\n    \"color\": \"#000000\",\n    \"font\": \"Arial\"\n}\n\n# Render entities.

Can you explain what the arrow from “San” to “Francisco” means?\nThis is what a dependency parse looks like compared to a syntax tree constituent analysis and is from Chapter 19 of Jurafsky & Martin. Arguments to relations are heads and dependents. Heads are the organizing word and dependents are like modifiers. These are labeled with grammatical functions like “Nominal subject” or “Direct object.”\nFor example, (NSUBJ) United canceled the (DOBJ) flight.\nThe example below shows what a dependency parse sentence diagram looks like. Note the direction of the arrows. “flight” and “me” are connected to the root “Book.” They are dependent on “Book.”\nSimilarly, “morning” is dependent on “flight.” And “the” is dependent on “morning flight.” In fact, every structure is dependent on another – starting with the root.\n\nThe Universal Dependencies project is a community effort to align a grammar across more than 100 language with an inventory of 37 dependency relations.\nNotably, dependency parsing answers questions like: - who did what to whom? - what modifies what? - what organizations below to which phrase?\nUnlike consituency parsers which use the sentence as the root of the tree, dependency grammars place the main verb as the head of a clause (sentence embedded in a larger sentence).\nSo in our clause “she previously worked at Google Brain”, ‘worked’ is the root that everything depends on.\n\nshe is “who did it”\npreviously is “when”\nat Google Brain is “where” (oblique argument)\n\nSpaCy’s dependency parser works differently from POS tagging. Instead of assigning labels to individual tokens, it predicts relationships between tokens (which token is the head of which other token, and what type of dependency).\nThe parser uses a transition-based approach: - It processes the sentence incrementally, making a series of decisions (transitions) - At each step, it can perform actions like “attach this word to that word with label X” - It builds up the parse tree through these sequential decisions\nLike NER, it can use beam search to explore multiple parsing paths and find the most probable complete parse tree.\nThe key difference: POS assigns one label per token independently, while dependency parsing creates a structure where every token (except the root) must connect to exactly one head token.\nThis diagram is from Jurafsky & Martin Chapter 19.2 and is an illustration of transition-based parsing. It demonstrates shift-reduce parsing where we have a stack on which we build the parse, a buffer of tokens to parse, and a parser which takes actions on the prase via a predictor called an oracle. It can explore multiple paths, when doing so - though, that will slow this process down.\n\nThe parser walks through the sentence left-to-right, successively shifting items from the buffer onto the stack. At each time point we examine the top two elements on the stack, and the oracle makes a decision about what transition to apply to build the parse.\nThese are the tree transition operations on the top two elements of the stack:\n\nLEFTARC: Assert a head-dependent relation between the word at the top of the stack and the second word; remove the second word from the stack.\nRIGHTARC: Assert a head-dependent relation between the second word on the stack and the word at the top; remove the top word from the stack.\nSHIFT: Remove the word from the front of the input buffer and push it onto the stack.\n\nThis is a greedy algorithm - the oracle provides a single choice at each step and the parser proceeds with that choice and no other options are explored. There is no backtracking and a single parse is returned in the end.\nThink of it this way, the Oracle is a trained supervised algorithm that makes a decision over two tokens until there are no more rules to apply. It decides if it will shift a word onto the stack, or if it will assert a relationship (left or right) between two tokens. Recall, every token must connect to exactly one head token.\nBelow, we will tell SpaCy to give us the top three parses. Generally, we want a beam_width of 1 (one parse), because this is much faster.\nA “beam” is a set of top-scoring partial parse trees or hypotheses kept by a beam search algorithm. Beam search maintains a “beam width” of several promising candidates, expanding them and pruning less likely ones at each stage to avoid exponential complexity.\n\nnlp = get_nlp()\ndoc = nlp(sample_text)\nparser = nlp.get_pipe(\"parser\")\nbeams = parser.beam_parse([doc], beam_width=3)\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n\n\n\nhead_scores, label_scores = parser.scored_parses(beams)\nprint(f\"Number of alternatives: {len(beams[0].histories)}\")\nprint(f\"Probabilities: {beams[0].probs}\")\n\nNumber of alternatives: 3\nProbabilities: [0.7982435893632595, 0.17826448047596988, 0.023491930160770638]\n\n\nThe beams[0].probs shows the probabilities for the top 3 complete dependency parse trees:\n\n79.8% - The parse tree SpaCy chose (most probable)\n17.8% - Second-best alternative parse\n2.3% - Third-best alternative\n\nThe head_scores and label_scores from scored_parses() give you more detailed information about individual attachment decisions and dependency labels for each token in each parse.\nWant to look at what’s actually different between these three parse trees? We could decode the histories to see where they disagree.\n\nPart B Summary\nIn this section, you learned:\n\nDependency parsing captures grammatical relationships between words, showing who did what to whom.\nEach token connects to exactly one head, creating a tree structure with the main verb as root.\nSpaCy uses a transition-based parser that makes sequential decisions to build the parse.\nBeam search lets us see alternative parses and their probabilities, revealing where the parser is uncertain.\nThis approach is fast and works across languages, which is why spaCy chose it over constituency parsing.",

    "text": "Part C: Language Modeling as Probability Distributions\nNow we shift from analyzing existing text to understanding how computers predict text. This is the foundation of modern NLP: language models assign probabilities to sequences of words. When you use autocomplete on your phone or ChatGPT generates a response, language models are predicting what words should come next.\n\nStarting Simple: Bigram Models\nThe simplest language model considers only the immediately preceding word. Given “the quick brown,” what word is likely to follow? A bigram model looks at word pairs and counts how often each pair appeared in training data.\nThe first thing we are going to do is look at a simple bigram model. A bigram is a pair of consecutive units. These models perform surprisingly well! You can also build trigram models – three consecutive units, and four-gram models. All are simply types of ‘n-gram’ models.\nSo, for example,\n\nunigram - ‘the’\nbigram - ‘the man’\ntrigram - ‘the man with’\n4-gram - ‘the man with the’\n\nThe larger the chunk, the more context. We’ll look at n-grams more in depth later this semester.\n\ncorpus = \"\"\"\nI saw the man with the telescope yesterday.\nI saw the bird with my binoculars.\nThe man with the hat waved at me.\nI watched the show with great interest.\nThe telescope with the red lens was expensive.\nI observed the stars with the telescope.\nThe bird with colorful feathers flew away.\nShe saw him with her own eyes.\nThe man with the briefcase left early.\nI spotted the deer with the binoculars.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, Counter\nimport random\n\n\nclass BigramLM:\n    \"\"\"A simple bigram language model.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self):\n        self.bigram_counts = defaultdict(Counter)\n        self.unigram_counts = Counter()\n        \n    def train(self, text):\n        \"\"\"Train on a corpus of text.\"\"\"\n        # Simple tokenization\n        tokens = text.lower().replace('.', ' .').replace(',', ' ,').split()\n        \n        # Count unigrams\n        self.unigram_counts.update(tokens)\n        \n        # Count bigrams\n        for i in range(len(tokens) -

While “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” is a famous pangram (contains all letters), it’s actually quite rare compared to how often the model saw other phrases starting with “The quick brown fox…”\n2. Token probabilities are spread out - Notice we’re only showing the top 10. “jumped” might be ranked 50th or 100th with a very small probability.\n3. Tokenization - “jumped” might be split into multiple tokens (like “jump” + “ed”), making it even less likely to appear as a single next token.\nWant to check if “jumped” appears further down the list? We could increase k to see more possibilities, or we could score the specific continuation “jumped over the lazy dog” to see what probability the model assigns to it.\nNotice that we can give the entire context to DistilGPT2.\n\nIt’s considering the entire context “The quick brown fox”\nIt uses sub-tokens, and likely has a lot of “fox” followed by “es” in training data\nIt can handle words it’s never seen in an exact bigram pair 0 It’s been trained on massive amounts of text, and has much richer knowledge\n\n\n\nExperiments: What does ambiguity look like to an LLM?\nThe goal of this first experiment is to look at what “ambigious” (multiple possibilities) looks like to the transformer model. Above, we focused on next token probabilities. Now we want to hone in on what happens right at the point where a sentence may diverge into two possible sentence structures. Recall in that we have no possibility for doing this with POS, Named Entities, or Dependency Graphs in SpaCy. They pick the n-best sequence.\n\n# COUPLING EXPERIMENT 1: Distribution at ambiguity point\n# Cut point: Right after \"with the\" - what comes next?\n\n# The cut point for our primary sentence\nambiguity_prompt = \"I saw the man with the\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nPrompt: '{ambiguity_prompt}'\")\nprint(\"\\nAt this point, the model must 'decide' what comes next.\")\nprint(\"If 'telescope' follows, interpretation leans INSTRUMENT.\")\nprint(\"If a person-attribute word follows (hat, briefcase), it's ATTRIBUTE.\\n\")\n\ndist = get_next_token_distribution(ambiguity_prompt, k=10)\n\nprint(\"Top 10 next-token predictions:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nfor token, prob in dist:\n    bar = '█' * int(prob * 300)\n    print(f\"   '{token:12}' : {prob:.4f} {bar}\")\n\n\nPrompt: 'I saw the man with the'\n\nAt this point, the model must 'decide' what comes next.\nIf 'telescope' follows, interpretation leans INSTRUMENT.\nIf a person-attribute word follows (hat, briefcase), it's ATTRIBUTE.\n\nTop 10 next-token predictions:\n----------------------------------------\n   ' sword      ' : 0.0262 ███████\n   ' knife      ' : 0.0224 ██████\n   ' black      ' : 0.0209 ██████\n   ' gun        ' : 0.0187 █████\n   ' mask       ' : 0.0167 █████\n   ' head       ' : 0.0156 ████\n   ' beard      ' : 0.0136 ████\n   ' same       ' : 0.0125 ███\n   ' red        ' : 0.0121 ███\n   ' right      ' : 0.0099 ██\n\n\nExpected Observation:\n\nDistribution should be relatively SPREAD OUT (flat)\nMultiple plausible continuations have non-trivial probability\nThis ‘flatness’ reflects genuine ambiguity!\nUnlike spaCy’s single parse, the LM maintains uncertainty.\n\nLet’s see what happens when we push the LLM to look at two different structures.\n\n# COUPLING EXPERIMENT 2: Forced-Choice Interpretation Scores\n\n# Base prompt\nbase = \"I saw the man with the telescope\"\n\n# Continuations that force each interpretation\ninstrument_continuation = \" and got a clear view of his face.\"\nattribute_continuation = \" standing on the corner.\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nBase: '{base}'\")\nprint(f\"\\nContinuation A (INSTRUMENT): '{instrument_continuation}'\")\nprint(f\"Continuation B (ATTRIBUTE):  '{attribute_continuation}'\")\n\n# Score both\nscore_a = score_continuation(base, instrument_continuation)\nscore_b = score_continuation(base, attribute_continuation)\n\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"-\"*50)\nprint(\"Scores (higher = more likely):\")\nprint(f\"   INSTRUMENT: sum={score_a[0]:.3f}, avg={score_a[1]:.3f} ({score_a[2]} tokens)\")\nprint(f\"   ATTRIBUTE:  sum={score_b[0]:.3f}, avg={score_b[1]:.3f} ({score_b[2]} tokens)\")\n\nwinner = \"INSTRUMENT\" if score_a[1] &gt; score_b[1] else \"ATTRIBUTE\"\nprint(f\"\\n   Model preference: {winner}\")\n\n\nBase: 'I saw the man with the telescope'\n\nContinuation A (INSTRUMENT): ' and got a clear view of his face.'\nContinuation B (ATTRIBUTE):  ' standing on the corner.'\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nScores (higher = more likely):\n   INSTRUMENT: sum=-23.026, avg=-2.558 (9 tokens)\n   ATTRIBUTE:  sum=-17.139, avg=-3.428 (5 tokens)\n\n   Model preference: INSTRUMENT\n\n\nAgain, the scoring uses log probabilities - here’s what that means:\nLog probability: Instead of multiplying tiny probabilities (which gets numerically unstable), we add their logarithms. Since probabilities are between 0 and 1, log probabilities are negative numbers. Less negative = more likely.\nThe two scores reported: - sum - Total log probability across all tokens in the continuation - avg - Average log probability per token (sum divided by number of tokens)\nWhy INSTRUMENT won despite lower sum? - INSTRUMENT: 9 tokens, sum = -23.026, avg = -2.558 - ATTRIBUTE: 5 tokens, sum = -17.139, avg = -3.428\nThe average is more fair for comparison because longer sequences naturally have more negative sums. The INSTRUMENT continuation has a better average probability per token (-2.558 vs -3.428), meaning each word is more “expected” by the model in that context.\n\n# COUPLING EXPERIMENT 3: Complete side-by-side analysis\n\n# Define cut points and continuations for each sentence\nexperiments = [\n    {\n        \"label\": \"Primary (ambiguous)\",\n        \"sentence\": \"I saw the man with the telescope.\",\n        \"cut_prompt\": \"I saw the man with the\",\n        \"instrument_cont\": \" telescope and got a clear view.\",\n        \"attribute_cont\": \" telescope standing nearby.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"label\": \"Rewrite 1 (attribute likely)\",\n        \"sentence\": \"I saw the man with the red hat.\",\n        \"cut_prompt\": \"I saw the man with the red\",\n        \"instrument_cont\": \" hat and got a clear view.\",\n        \"attribute_cont\": \" hat standing nearby.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"label\": \"Rewrite 2 (instrument likely)\",\n        \"sentence\": \"I saw the bird with the telescope.\",\n        \"cut_prompt\": \"I saw the bird with the\",\n        \"instrument_cont\": \" telescope and got a clear view.\",\n        \"attribute_cont\": \" telescope perched nearby.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"label\": \"Rewrite 3 (instrument forced)\",\n        \"sentence\": \"I saw the man with my telescope.\",\n        \"cut_prompt\": \"I saw the man with my\",\n        \"instrument_cont\": \" telescope and got a clear view.\",\n        \"attribute_cont\": \" telescope standing nearby.\"\n    }\n]\n\nresults_table = []\n\nfor exp in experiments:\n    print(f\"\\n{'─'*60}\")\n    print(f\"📝 {exp['label']}\")\n    print(f\"   Sentence: {exp['sentence']}\")\n    \n    # Get spaCy parse\n    nlp = get_nlp()\n    doc = nlp(exp['sentence'])\n    with_token = [t for t in doc if t.text.lower() == \"with\"][0]\n    spacy_attachment = with_token.head.text\n    spacy_interp = \"INSTRUMENT\" if spacy_attachment in [\"saw\", \"see\"] else \"ATTRIBUTE\"\n    \n    # Get LM distribution\n    dist = get_next_token_distribution(exp['cut_prompt'], k=5)\n    top_token = dist[0][0].strip() if dist else \"?\"\n    top_prob = dist[0][1] if dist else 0\n    \n    # Calculate entropy-like measure (is distribution sharp or flat?)\n    probs = [p for _, p in dist[:5]]\n    max_prob = max(probs) if probs else 0\n    sharpness = \"SHARP\" if max_prob &gt; 0.3 else \"FLAT\"\n    \n    # Score continuations\n    instr_score = score_continuation(exp['cut_prompt'], exp['instrument_cont'])\n    attr_score = score_continuation(exp['cut_prompt'], exp['attribute_cont'])\n    lm_preference = \"INSTRUMENT\" if instr_score[1] &gt; attr_score[1] else \"ATTRIBUTE\"\n    \n    print(f\"   spaCy: 'with' → {spacy_attachment} ({spacy_interp})\")\n    print(f\"   LM top-1: '{top_token}' ({top_prob:.3f}), dist={sharpness}\")\n    print(f\"   LM preference: {lm_preference}\")\n    \n    results_table.append({\n        \"Sentence\": exp['label'][:20],\n        \"spaCy Parse\": spacy_interp,\n        \"Top-1 Token\": top_token[:10],\n        \"Distribution\": sharpness,\n        \"LM Preference\": lm_preference\n    })\n\nsummary_df = pd.DataFrame(results_table)\nprint(summary_df.to_string(index=False))\n\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n📝 Primary (ambiguous)\n   Sentence: I saw the man with the telescope.\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n   spaCy: 'with' → man (ATTRIBUTE)\n   LM top-1: 'sword' (0.026), dist=FLAT\n   LM preference: INSTRUMENT\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n📝 Rewrite 1 (attribute likely)\n   Sentence: I saw the man with the red hat.\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n   spaCy: 'with' → man (ATTRIBUTE)\n   LM top-1: '-' (0.069), dist=FLAT\n   LM preference: INSTRUMENT\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n📝 Rewrite 2 (instrument likely)\n   Sentence: I saw the bird with the telescope.\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n   spaCy: 'with' → saw (INSTRUMENT)\n   LM top-1: 'eye' (0.027), dist=FLAT\n   LM preference: INSTRUMENT\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n📝 Rewrite 3 (instrument forced)\n   Sentence: I saw the man with my telescope.\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n   spaCy: 'with' → saw (INSTRUMENT)\n   LM top-1: 'hands' (0.039), dist=FLAT\n   LM preference: INSTRUMENT\n            Sentence spaCy Parse Top-1 Token Distribution LM Preference\n Primary (ambiguous)   ATTRIBUTE       sword         FLAT    INSTRUMENT\nRewrite 1 (attribute   ATTRIBUTE           -         FLAT    INSTRUMENT\nRewrite 2 (instrumen  INSTRUMENT         eye         FLAT    INSTRUMENT\nRewrite 3 (instrumen  INSTRUMENT       hands         FLAT    INSTRUMENT\n\n\nLooking at this summary table, there are some interesting observations:\nSpaCy’s behavior: It makes a single parse decision for each sentence.

    "text": "Part D: Sentiment Analysis\nNow let’s turn to the application of NLP to real-world problems! We’ll look at both sentiment analysis and summarization. In both cases we’ll look at traditional, predictive methods and LLM’s to see how they differ.\nSentiment analysis determines whether text expresses positive, negative, or neutral feelings. This is one of the most common NLP applications—companies analyze customer reviews, social media monitors track brand perception, and researchers study public opinion.\nWe will compare two approaches: a traditional rule-based method (VADER) and an LLM-based method.\n\nClassical Approach: VADER\nVADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a rule-based sentiment analyzer designed for social media text. It works by looking up words in a sentiment dictionary and applying rules for negation, intensifiers, and punctuation. We may spend time using it because it is easy to use, hack, and understand. Plus, you can use VADER output to help train another model.\n\ntry:\n    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n    vader = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\nexcept LookupError:\n    nltk.download(\"vader_lexicon\")\n    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n    vader = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n\n# Initialize VADER\nvader = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n\n\n# Sentiment-ambiguous test cases\ntest_utterances = [\n    \"Oh great, another meeting that could have been an email.\",  # Sarcasm\n    \"The food was not unpleasant, I suppose.\",  # Double negative, hedged\n]\n\nWhy VADER? It’s a rule-based sentiment analyzer that uses:\n\nA sentiment lexicon (word → score mappings)\nGrammatical rules (negation, intensifiers, etc.)\nPunctuation and capitalization heuristics\nFast, deterministic, and interpretable!\n\n\n# VADER analysis\n\nvader_results = []\nfor text in test_utterances:\n    scores = vader.polarity_scores(text)\n    \n    # Determine label from compound score\n    if scores['compound'] &gt;= 0.05:\n        label = \"POSITIVE\"\n    elif scores['compound'] &lt;= -0.05:\n        label = \"NEGATIVE\"\n    else:\n        label = \"NEUTRAL\"\n    \n    vader_results.append({\n        \"text\": text[:40] + \"...\",\n        \"label\": label,\n        \"compound\": scores['compound'],\n        \"pos\": scores['pos'],\n        \"neg\": scores['neg'],\n        \"neu\": scores['neu']\n    })\n    \n    print(f\"\\nText: \\\"{text}\\\"\")\n    print(f\"   Compound: {scores['compound']:.3f} → {label}\")\n    print(f\"   (pos={scores['pos']:.2f}, neg={scores['neg']:.2f}, neu={scores['neu']:.2f})\")\n\n\nText: \"Oh great, another meeting that could have been an email.\"\n   Compound: 0.625 → POSITIVE\n   (pos=0.31, neg=0.00, neu=0.69)\n\nText: \"The food was not unpleasant, I suppose.\"\n   Compound: 0.372 → POSITIVE\n   (pos=0.34, neg=0.00, neu=0.66)\n\n\nLook at the results: VADER labeled both sentences as positive! The first sentence is sarcastic—“great” is used ironically. The second has a double negative (“not unpleasant”) which VADER handled okay. This illustrates a key limitation of rule-based systems: they cannot understand context, irony, or nuance.\n\n\nLLM Approach\nLLMs can potentially catch subtleties that rule-based systems miss. If you have API access to an LLM, feel free to play with this to make it work with your API. If not, just read the output and follow along.\n\ndef safe_llm_unavailable_response(reason=\"LLM unavailable\"):\n    return {\n        \"label\": \"neutral\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.0,\n        \"rationale\": reason,\n        \"cues\": []\n    }\n\n\ndef analyze_sentiment_llm(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyze sentiment using available LLM.\n    Always returns (response_text, provider).\n    Silently falls back if LLM is unavailable.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not llm_available():\n        return (\n            json.dumps(\n                safe_llm_unavailable_response(\"LLM unavailable\"),\n                ensure_ascii=False\n            ),\n            \"unavailable\"\n        )\n\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\nAnalyze the sentiment of this text and respond with ONLY valid JSON.\n\nText: \"{text}\"\n\nRespond with this exact JSON format (no other text):\n\n{{\n  \"label\": \"positive\" | \"negative\" | \"neutral\" | \"mixed\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"brief explanation\",\n  \"cues\": []\n}}\n\"\"\"\n\n    try:\n        response = chat(prompt)\n        response_text = response.choices[0].message.content\n        return response_text, \"llm\"\n    except Exception:\n        return (\n            json.dumps(\n                safe_llm_unavailable_response(\"LLM call failed\"),\n                ensure_ascii=False\n            ),\n            \"error\"\n        )\n\n\ndef parse_sentiment_json(response_text):\n    \"\"\"Safely parse JSON from LLM response.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    \n    # Try to extract JSON from response\n    try:\n        # First try direct parse\n        return json.loads(response_text)\n    except:\n        pass\n    \n    # Try to find JSON in the response\n    try:\n        json_match = re.search(r'\\{[^}]+\\}', response_text, re.DOTALL)\n        if json_match:\n            return json.loads(json_match.group())\n    except:\n        pass\n    \n    # Return error structure\n    return {\n        \"label\": \"parse_error\",\n        \"confidence\": 0,\n        \"rationale\": f\"Could not parse: {response_text[:100]}\",\n        \"cues\": []\n    }\n\n\n# Analyze each utterance\nllm_results = []\n\nfor text in test_utterances:\n    print(f\"\\nText: \\\"{text}\\\"\")\n    response, provider = analyze_sentiment_llm(text)\n    print(f\"   Provider: {provider}\")\n    \n    parsed = parse_sentiment_json(response)\n    llm_results.append(parsed)\n    \n    print(f\"   Label: {parsed.get('label', 'N/A')}\")\n    print(f\"   Confidence: {parsed.get('confidence', 'N/A')}\")\n    print(f\"   Rationale: {parsed.get('rationale', 'N/A')}\")\n    print(f\"   Cues: {parsed.get('cues', [])}\")\nif len(llm_results) &lt; len(test_utterances):\n    print(\"Some LLM sentiment analyses failed; comparison table may be incomplete.\")\n\n\nText: \"Oh great, another meeting that could have been an email.\"\n   Provider: llm\n   Label: negative\n   Confidence: 0.95\n   Rationale: The phrase uses sarcasm ('Oh great') to express frustration about an unnecessary meeting, indicating clear dissatisfaction.\n   Cues: ['Oh great', 'could have been an email', 'sarcastic tone', 'frustration with unnecessary meetings']\n\nText: \"The food was not unpleasant, I suppose.\"\n   Provider: llm\n   Label: mixed\n   Confidence: 0.75\n   Rationale: The double negative 'not unpleasant' suggests mild approval, but the hesitant phrase 'I suppose' indicates lukewarm enthusiasm and uncertainty, creating an overall ambivalent tone.\n   Cues: ['not unpleasant', 'I suppose', 'double negative', 'hesitant tone', 'lack of enthusiasm']\n\n\nIf you’ve run this cell and lost the output, you can use this:\nText: “Oh great, another meeting that could have been an email.” Provider: llm Label: negative Confidence: 0.95 Rationale: The phrase uses sarcasm (‘Oh great’) to express frustration about an unnecessary meeting, indicating clear dissatisfaction.

They get added to the pipeline and run automatically when you call nlp(text).\nHere’s the basic structure:\n\n@spacy.Language.component(\"component_name\")\ndef custom_component(doc):\n    # Do something with doc\n    # You can add custom attributes, modify tokens, etc.\n    return doc\n\n# Add it to the pipeline\nnlp.add_pipe(\"component_name\", last=True)\n\n&lt;function __main__.custom_component(doc)&gt;\n\n\nFor this specific task – flagging sentences with both ORG and DATE entities), we want to:\n\nIterate through the doc’s sentences\nCheck what entity types appear in each sentence\nStore a flag somewhere (maybe as a custom attribute on the Span - a slice of a doc object)\n\n\n# Create a custom spaCy component\nfrom spacy.language import Language\nfrom spacy.tokens import Doc\n\n@Language.component(\"org_date_flagger\")\ndef org_date_flagger(doc):\n    \"\"\"Flag sentences that contain both ORG and DATE entities.\"\"\"\n    # Add custom attribute to doc if not exists\n    if not doc.has_extension(\"flagged_sentences\"):\n        from spacy.tokens import Doc\n        Doc.set_extension(\"flagged_sentences\", default=[])\n    \n    flagged = []\n    for sent in doc.sents:\n        sent_ents = [ent.label_ for ent in sent.ents]\n        if \"ORG\" in sent_ents and \"DATE\" in sent_ents:\n            flagged.append(sent.text)\n    \n    doc._.flagged_sentences = flagged\n    return doc\n\n# Add to pipeline (only if not already there)\nif \"org_date_flagger\" not in nlp.pipe_names:\n    nlp.add_pipe(\"org_date_flagger\", last=True)\n\nprint(f\"\\nUpdated pipeline: {nlp.pipe_names}\")\n\n\nUpdated pipeline: ['tok2vec', 'tagger', 'parser', 'attribute_ruler', 'lemmatizer', 'ner', 'component_name', 'org_date_flagger']\n\n\nThe doc._ syntax is spaCy’s way of accessing custom extensions that you’ve added to a Doc object.\nHere’s why this design:\nBuilt-in attributes use direct access: - doc.ents (entities) - doc.text (text) - token.pos_ (part of speech)\nCustom attributes use the underscore namespace: - doc._.flagged_sentences (your custom attribute) - token._.custom_score (if you created this)\nThis separation prevents naming conflicts—your custom flagged_sentences won’t accidentally override something built into spaCy. It also makes it clear when you’re using custom vs. built-in functionality.\nThe underscore is a special namespace that spaCy reserves for user extensions. You must register extensions with Doc.set_extension() before using them, which is what the code does with the if not doc.has_extension() check.\n\n# Test the custom component\ntest_text = \"\"\"Microsoft announced record earnings on January 24th, 2024.\nThe weather was sunny. Apple plans to release new products in March.\nJohn went to the store.\"\"\"\n\ndoc = nlp(test_text)\n\nprint(\"\\nTest text:\")\nprint(test_text)\nprint(\"\\n\\n Sentences containing both ORG and DATE:\\n\\n\")\nfor sent in doc._.flagged_sentences:\n    print(sent)\n\n\nTest text:\nMicrosoft announced record earnings on January 24th, 2024.\nThe weather was sunny. Apple plans to release new products in March.\nJohn went to the store.\n\n\n Sentences containing both ORG and DATE:\n\n\nMicrosoft announced record earnings on January 24th, 2024.\n\nApple plans to release new products in March.\n\n\n\n\narticle = \"In the Blue Ridge, the Christmas season was celebrated for days on end, with gatherings of family and friends, good food, and lots of music.

The first sentence is actually providing geographic context, while the second describes the actual tradition.\nThis is a classic problem with simple extractive summarizers—they use heuristics (like “entities are important”) that don’t always align with what humans find most relevant.\nCan you think of how you might modify the scoring to better capture the main idea of this passage?\n\ndef llm_summarize(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate abstractive summary using available LLM.\n    Silently falls back if LLM is unavailable.\n    Always returns plain text.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not llm_available():\n        return (\n            \"HEADLINE: Summary unavailable\\n\\n\"\n            \"• LLM disabled or unavailable\\n\"\n            \"• Skipping abstractive summarization\\n\"\n            \"• Proceeding with notebook execution\"\n        )\n\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\nSummarize this article in exactly:\n\n- 3 bullet points (key facts)\n- 1 headline (max 10 words)\n\nArticle:\n{text}\n\nFormat exactly as:\n\nHEADLINE: &lt;headline&gt;\n• &lt;bullet 1&gt;\n• &lt;bullet 2&gt;\n• &lt;bullet 3&gt;\n\"\"\"\n\n    try:\n        response = chat(prompt)\n        # handle both raw string and ModelResponse\n        if hasattr(response, \"choices\"):\n            return response.choices[0].message.content\n        return str(response)\n\n    except Exception:\n        return (\n            \"HEADLINE: Summary unavailable\\n\\n\"\n            \"• LLM call failed\\n\"\n            \"• No impact on remaining analysis\\n\"\n            \"• Safe fallback applied\"\n        )\n\n\nsummary_text = llm_summarize(article)\nprint(summary_text)\n\nHEADLINE: Blue Ridge Christmas Celebrated for 12 Days\n\n• Breaking up Christmas was a traditional 12-day celebration in the Blue Ridge region around Mount Airy, NC and Galax, VA\n• The festivities began on December 25th and featured family gatherings, food, and extensive music and dancing\n• Mountain residents traveled house to house visiting neighbors throughout the entire celebration period\n\n\nIf you ran this cell and lost the LLM output, you can use this:\nHEADLINE: Blue Ridge Christmas Celebrated for 12 Days\n• Breaking up Christmas was a traditional 12-day celebration in the Blue Ridge region around Mount Airy, NC and Galax, VA • The festivities began on December 25th and featured family gatherings, food, and extensive music and dancing • Mountain residents traveled house to house visiting neighbors throughout the entire celebration period\nAs you may already know, LLMs are non-deterministic (can produce different outputs from the same input) and can:\n\nHallucinate facts not in the original\nOver-generalize or lose nuance\n\n\n\nReflection\nSubmit:\n\nWhat are two advantages of spaCy’s modular pipeline approach?\nWhen would you choose extractive over abstractive summarization?\n\n\nq7_answer = \"Your answer about pipeline advantages\"\n\n\nq8_answer = \"Your answer about summarization choice\"\n\n\n\nPart E Summary\nIn this section, we tackled a different task and showed you the flexibility of spaCy to incorporate custom components:\n\nSpaCy pipelines are modular—you can add custom components that run automatically when processing text.\nCustom extensions (accessed via doc._) let you attach your own data to Doc, Span, or Token objects.\nExtractive summarization selects existing sentences based on scoring heuristics—transparent but limited.\nAbstractive summarization (LLM) generates new text—flexible but can hallucinate or lose nuance.\nChoose based on your needs: extractive for verifiable, traceable summaries; abstractive for readable, condensed versions.",

    "text": "Introduction to Corpus Design and EDA\nIn traditional corpus linguistics, the word corpus refers to a sample of language data that strives to be representative of a particular language variety. Language variety is a general term for language that shares one or more common traits, such as dialect, genre, or topic.\nIn this week’s classroom activity, you will examine corpora designed to study distributional properties of language. Such corpora are sampled with careful tracking of demographic and linguistic representativeness. They are also labeled with high-quality annotations to capture linguistic features of interest. This sampling and annotation allows for reproducible, high-confidence analyses.\nThat said, designed corpora come with a great amount of exploratory data analysis already included in metadata. For example, often included are descriptive statistics such as number of sentences, words, etc. Thus today, you will do EDA with basic statistics and analysis using spaCy.\nNext week you will use NLP techniques such as parsing, pattern recognition, and named entity recognition to infer labels and describe and compare two sets of related data. What you won’t do at this point is assess the accuracy of your labeling.\n\nThe Purpose of EDA\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and summarizing datasets to understand their main characteristics before applying formal modeling or hypothesis testing. For text data, EDA involves understanding vocabulary, document lengths, word distributions, and linguistic patterns.\nData collection and analysis serve one goal: answering questions with data. With that in mind, EDA serves a few purposes: 1. Ensure representativeness of the population or phenomenon under consideration - to make sure that the phenomena you seek are present in the data - to identify and account for outliers or other anomalies 2. Reveal characteristics of data that might affect the generalizability or validity of your analysis 3. Provide insight into features that can be helpful in answering your data analytic questions\n\n\nQuestions to Kick-off EDA\nYou can start an EDA by asking some fundamental questions, such as: - How can I make sure my data is representative of the people or phenomena I want to describe? - Do I have enough data? - e.g., if using a sentiment lexicon, do the words in the lexicon appear often enough to provide a basis for analysis - What is the structure of my data? - threaded conversation-like discourse with identifiable speakers - Do I have enough information about the speakers to generalize about them? - Do I have enough text per speaker? - news articles that all start with a summary of new information - academic literature with a keyword list and abstract - sports reports where I might find tables with statistics - What metadata is available? - user profiles with demographic information - topic lists - hashtags that might act like topic or discourse labels - What useful features can be derived from the data? - would grouping the data into topics make sense? - do I need to extract person names or @mentions to answer the question at hand?",

    "text": "Corpus-Level Overview\n\nDataset Description\n\n\nIntroduction\nOur goal for this lab is to do exploratory data analysis on a collection from Twitter.\nYour dataset is comprised of two CSV files. They were both collected in 2020 using Tweepy, a Python library for accessing Twitter’s API. Two searches were conducted, with a maximum number of English language tweets of 5000, and with retweets filtered out during collection.\nHashtags used for search were: 1. #covidhoax OR #notomask 2. #covidisreal OR #wearamask\nThis collection was created specifically for students of NLP in a prior semester. The data is not representative of any population and is not intended for publication or re-distribution.\nWe will explore and describe this dataset using descriptive statistics first. Then we will compare the two collections using other spaCy capabilities.\nPlease do not share or post these CSV files. Despite changes in Twitter ownership, they come with licensing restrictions. In the past, I had students collect this data individually. Since that’s no longer an easy option, you will use pre-collected data. The licensing restriction applicable to the 2020 collection is documented here.\n\nYou may not “sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, redistribute, syndicate… or otherwise transfer or provide access to… the Licensed Material to any third party except as expressly permitted,” which means you should not give students a large raw dump designed to let them avoid having their own relationship with the API.\n\n\nIn practice, for a small academic exercise: it is acceptable to share a modest tweet subset with students inside your course context, provided it is non‑commercial, secured, not a bulk replacement for the API, and you honor deletion/visibility changes and the privacy and usage rules in the Developer Policy.",

    "text": "A - Token-Level Distributions\nWe’ll start with basic descriptive statistics. In particular, we’re interested in:\n\nhashtag counts\ntoken counts\nword length\ntweets (documents)\nand tweet (document) length.\n\nLet’s take a step back and think about what we are counting when we talk about tokens.\nWe already know tokens are a basic unit of processing—individual instances of words, punctuation, or other text elements as they appear in a document. A type is a distinct word form; it represents the unique vocabulary item regardless of how many times it appears. In fact, we often think of words as canonical tokens.\n\nKey distinction: If a document contains “the cat and the dog,” it has 5 tokens but only 4 types (since “the” appears twice).\n\nFrom spaCy documentation:\n\nIn spaCy, a lexeme is a vocabulary entry keyed by the hash of a string form (ORTH), representing a word type (form) with context‑independent attributes like casing, shape, and optional vector, but no token-level context such as POS or dependency.\nIn spaCy, a lexeme is “a word type, as opposed to a word token,” stored in Vocab and shared by all tokens with the same ORTH (string hash).\nspaCy maintains a StringStore mapping each distinct string to a unique integer ID; the same ID (ORTH) is used to index a Lexeme in Vocab.\nWhen a new string appears (e.g., during tokenization or when you access nlp.vocab[“word”]), spaCy creates or retrieves the corresponding lexeme keyed by that ORTH value.\n\nWhile there are lots of ways to think about vocabulary and count things, you should always be careful to explain how you counted. In the function below, we are counting objects that: - have already been pre-processed - are lower-cased - are not whitespace characters.\nget_vocab() (below) is a function builds a vocabulary set by iterating through all texts, processing each through spaCy’s pipeline, extracting each token’s lowercase text, and filtering out whitespace. The result is the set of unique word forms (types) in the corpus.\n\ndef get_vocab(texts, nlp):\n    \"\"\"Return set of unique lowercased token strings from texts.\"\"\"\n    if hasattr(texts, \"tolist\"):\n        texts = texts.tolist()\n    return {\n        tok.text.lower()\n        for doc in nlp.pipe((t for t in texts if isinstance(t, str)))\n        for tok in doc\n        if not tok.is_space\n    }\n\nnlp = get_nlp()  # if you want this cell to be standalone\npromask_vocab = get_vocab(df.loc[df.group == \"promask\", \"tweet_text\"], nlp)\nantimask_vocab = get_vocab(df.loc[df.group == \"antimask\", \"tweet_text\"], nlp)\ncombined_vocab = promask_vocab | antimask_vocab\n\ndict(\n    promask=len(promask_vocab),\n    antimask=len(antimask_vocab),\n    combined=len(combined_vocab),\n    shared=len(promask_vocab & antimask_vocab),\n)\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n\n\n{'promask': 17753, 'antimask': 8293, 'combined': 22939, 'shared': 3107}\n\n\ncompute_token_counts(): counts the number of tokens in each document by processing texts through spaCy and returning the length of each resulting Doc object.\n\ndef compute_token_counts(texts):\n    nlp = get_nlp()\n    if hasattr(texts, \"tolist\"):\n        texts = texts.tolist()\n    return [\n        len(doc)\n        for doc in nlp.pipe((t for t in texts if isinstance(t, str)))\n    ]\n\ndf[\"token_count\"] = compute_token_counts(df[\"tweet_text\"])\ndf[\"token_count\"]\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n\n\n0       13\n1       23\n2       12\n3       29\n4       25\n        ..\n7064    31\n7065    23\n7066    22\n7067    28\n7068    24\nName: token_count, Length: 7069, dtype: int64\n\n\nLet’s check for missing data.\n\nmissing = df[['created_date', 'hashtags', 'num_hashtags', 'tweet_length', 'tweet_text', 'group']].isnull().sum()\nmissing\n\ncreated_date       0\nhashtags        2419\nnum_hashtags       0\ntweet_length       0\ntweet_text         0\ngroup              0\ndtype: int64\n\n\nWe might not care if hashtags are missing, though it is interesting that such a large number of tweets don’t contain them.

First, the tokenizer splits the text on whitespace similar to the split() function. 2. Then the tokenizer checks whether the substring matches the tokenizer exception rules. For example, “don’t” does not contain whitespace, but should be split into two tokens, “do” and “n’t”, while “N.Y.” should remain one token. 3. Then, it checks for a prefix, suffix, or infix in a substring; these include commas, periods, hyphens, or quotes. If it matches, the substring is split into two tokens.\nHere’s an illustration of how this works from: https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101#annotations-token\n\nThis tutorial has excellent examples: https://machinelearningknowledge.ai/complete-guide-to-spacy-tokenizer-with-examples/\nSpaCy’s tokenizer doesn’t handle hashtags… which makes sense if your data has ‘#’ for other purposes! But you can modify tokenization behavior, if you need to.\nBelow is a simple algorithm for make_hashtag_friendly_nlp(): This function modifies spaCy’s default tokenizer by removing “#” from the list of prefix characters. By default, spaCy treats “#” as a prefix and splits it from the following word. After modification, hashtags like “#wearamask” remain as single tokens instead of being split into “#” and “wearamask”.\nWe aren’t using this function with our dataset because we were given a csv with hashtags broken out. But imagine you didn’t have them broken out!\n\nfrom spacy.util import compile_prefix_regex\n\ndef make_hashtag_friendly_nlp():\n    nlp = get_nlp()\n    prefixes = [p for p in nlp.Defaults.prefixes if p != \"#\"]\n    prefix_regex = compile_prefix_regex(prefixes)\n    nlp.tokenizer.prefix_search = prefix_regex.search\n    return nlp\n\nhtag_test = \"This is a hashtag #testmyhashtag.\"\n\n# Default behavior\nnlp_default = get_nlp()\nprint(\"Default tokenized text:\")\nfor tok in nlp_default(htag_test):\n    print(tok)\n\n# Modified behavior\nnlp_hashtag = make_hashtag_friendly_nlp()\nprint(\"\\nText after removing the # prefix:\")\nfor tok in nlp_hashtag(htag_test):\n    print(tok)\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\nDefault tokenized text:\nThis\nis\na\nhashtag\n#\ntestmyhashtag\n.\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n\nText after removing the # prefix:\nThis\nis\na\nhashtag\n#testmyhashtag\n.\n\n\n\n\nGather some statistics\nNow let’s gather more statistics! - Number of tweets (documents) - Average length in tokens (with histogram and percentile table) - Identify documents that are unusually short or long using spaCy’s token counts - Look for outliers in document length (bottom 1% and top 1%)\nThen we’ll look at some of our hashtags.\nAgain, it’s really useful to export to a CSV file to examine in Excel or whatever you use for viewing structured data if you need to look at your data more carefully.\n\ndf.groupby('group').size()\n\ngroup\nantimask    2069\npromask     5000\ndtype: int64\n\n\nThe number of documents between groups is not equal; we’ll need to keep this in mind for some kinds of comparisons.\n\ndf.groupby('group')['token_count'].mean()\n\ngroup\nantimask    21.899952\npromask     22.209600\nName: token_count, dtype: float64\n\n\nLet’s find documents that are unusually short or long using spaCy’s token counts.

The longest 1% have 34+ tokens and may contain a lot of emoji or punctuation that spaCy splits up.\n\n\nHashtags\nLet’s think about hashtags now. If we want to compare counts across groups we’ll need to normalize them. We already know the groups are not the same size. Raw counts would simply reflect a greater opportunity for hashtags to appear—not a stronger association with the group.\nWhen we normalize hashtag frequencies, we can ask questions such as how characteristic is this hashtag (per group) relative to the overall group’s hashtag activity? We can think of this as an analysis of hashtag saliency (the degree to which something stands out or is prominent) rather than volume.\nTo normalize, we’ll count how often each hashtag appears in the group and then divide by the total. This is a relative frequency. This answers the question: Out of all the hashtags used by this group, how prominent is this one?\nHashtag normalization:\nThe code below: - explodes the hashtag column so each hashtag gets its own row - counts occurrences per group - computes the total hashtags per group, and - divides each hashtag count by the group total to get relative frequency.\n\n# explode hashtags into one-per-row\nhashtags = (\n    df.dropna(subset=[\"hashtags\"])\n      .assign(hashtag=df[\"hashtags\"].str.split())\n      .explode(\"hashtag\")\n)\n\n# count hashtags per group\nhashtag_counts = (\n    hashtags.groupby([\"group\", \"hashtag\"])\n            .size()\n            .rename(\"count\")\n            .reset_index()\n)\n\n# total hashtags per group\ntotal_hashtags = (\n    hashtag_counts.groupby(\"group\")[\"count\"]\n                   .sum()\n                   .rename(\"total\")\n)\n\n# join and normalize\nhashtag_norm = (\n    hashtag_counts\n        .merge(total_hashtags, on=\"group\")\n        .assign(rel_freq=lambda d: d[\"count\"] / d[\"total\"])\n        .sort_values([\"group\", \"rel_freq\"], ascending=[True, False])\n)\n\n# inspect top normalized hashtags\nhashtag_norm.groupby(\"group\").head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup\nhashtag\ncount\ntotal\nrel_freq\n\n\n\n\n139\nantimask\nCovidHoax\n707\n2982\n0.237089\n\n\n642\nantimask\ncovidhoax\n218\n2982\n0.073105\n\n\n71\nantimask\nCOVID19\n110\n2982\n0.036888\n\n\n70\nantimask\nCOVID\n47\n2982\n0.015761\n\n\n370\nantimask\nNoMasks\n40\n2982\n0.013414\n\n\n635\nantimask\ncovidHOAX\n40\n2982\n0.013414\n\n\n797\nantimask\nplandemic\n40\n2982\n0.013414\n\n\n627\nantimask\ncoronavirus\n37\n2982\n0.012408\n\n\n407\nantimask\nPlandemic\n36\n2982\n0.012072\n\n\n466\nantimask\nScamdemic\n34\n2982\n0.011402\n\n\n2229\npromask\nWearAMask\n1893\n7790\n0.243004\n\n\n3521\npromask\nwearamask\n419\n7790\n0.053787\n\n\n1059\npromask\nCOVID19\n262\n7790\n0.033633\n\n\n2275\npromask\nWritingCommunity\n88\n7790\n0.011297\n\n\n1950\npromask\nStayAtHomeSaveLives\n86\n7790\n0.011040\n\n\n1085\npromask\nCOVIDー19\n79\n7790\n0.010141\n\n\n2226\npromask\nWearADamnMask\n67\n7790\n0.008601\n\n\n2490\npromask\ncoronavirus\n63\n7790\n0.008087\n\n\n3513\npromask\nwashyourhands\n53\n7790\n0.006804\n\n\n2934\npromask\nmask\n47\n7790\n0.006033\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlaringly obvious now is that we haven’t attempted to normalize case or spelling of hashtags.\nAlways remember that these seemingly mundane details of preprocessing can have substantial impact on your analysis. Imagine what would happen to a sentiment analysis program that removed negation (e.g. not and n’t) - how would it differentiate between not happy and happy?!\nAnd, while we just normalized total hashtags, you could also normalize across the number of tweets.\nLet’s look at a side-by-side table of our group’s normalized frequencies\n\n# pivot to side-by-side table\nhashtag_pivot = (\n    hashtag_norm\n        .pivot(index=\"hashtag\", columns=\"group\", values=\"rel_freq\")\n        .fillna(0)\n)\n\n(\n# show hashtags that are prominent in either group\nhashtag_pivot\n    .assign(max_freq=lambda d: d.max(axis=1))\n    .sort_values(\"max_freq\", ascending=False)\n    .drop(columns=\"max_freq\")\n    .head(15)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup\nantimask\npromask\n\n\nhashtag\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWearAMask\n0.000671\n0.243004\n\n\nCovidHoax\n0.237089\n0.000000\n\n\ncovidhoax\n0.073105\n0.000128\n\n\nwearamask\n0.001006\n0.053787\n\n\nCOVID19\n0.036888\n0.033633\n\n\nCOVID\n0.015761\n0.004236\n\n\ncovidHOAX\n0.013414\n0.000000\n\n\nplandemic\n0.013414\n0.000257\n\n\nNoMasks\n0.013414\n0.000257\n\n\ncoronavirus\n0.012408\n0.008087\n\n\nPlandemic\n0.012072\n0.000000\n\n\nScamdemic\n0.011402\n0.000000\n\n\nWritingCommunity\n0.000335\n0.011297\n\n\nStayAtHomeSaveLives\n0.000000\n0.011040\n\n\nCOVIDHOAX\n0.010396\n0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome directions you could go with this:\nWhich hashtags appear strongly associated with one group but nearly absent in the other?\nWhich hashtags appear in both groups, but with very different relative frequencies?\nHow does normalization change your interpretation compared to raw counts?\nEven accounting for case differences and aggregrating counts where there are spelling differences, stylistic choices will still fragment the signal.\nA discriminative analytical approach would move you towards looking at what hashtags are most characteristic (or disproportionately associated with) each group.\n\n\nEmojis\nAnother kind of “word” you could look at are emojis. As you go through this analysis, think about what emoji mean. Do they participate in irony, sarcasm? Do they indicate mood, feelings? What are the many ways people use emoji in short-form text like this?\nIn the cell below, we are using the regex library to find a pattern with the unicode property. means “match any character with this unicode property.” If you are already familiar with regular expressions, Regex has much better support for unicode than re.\nNext week, you have the opportunity to take a regex lab (or a continuation of this one which is more advanced). \\p{Emoji_Presentation} below is a unicode binary property you can reference from this page: https://www.regular-expressions.info/refunicodeproperty.html. Unicode is a huge and important topic in NLP.

Skin-tone modifiers combine with other characters, though when by themselves they are rendered as placeholders. They were split off from their base emoji. To fix further, we would need to treat them together and use another approach to extract them.\nConsider the following questions:\nWhich emojis appear strongly associated with one group?\nWhich emojis appear in both groups but with very different relative frequencies?\nHow do emoji patterns compare to hashtags in terms of emotional tone or stance?\nStance refers to the speaker’s or writer’s position, attitude, or point of view toward a topic, idea, or other participants in discourse. It’s clear that emojis are rich signals that communicate affect (feelings), opinions, social cues such as solidarity, and more. We’ll look at stance more next week.\n\n\nSection A Summary: Token-Level Distributions\nIn this section, you learned how to: - Build vocabulary sets and count unique word types across different groups - Compare tokenization methods (simple split() vs. spaCy) and understand why they produce different results - Identify tokenization challenges in social media text: hashtags, emoji, punctuation, contractions, and special characters - Customize spaCy’s tokenizer by modifying prefix rules to keep hashtags intact - Calculate descriptive statistics including document counts, token counts, and percentile distributions - Normalize frequency counts to enable fair comparisons between groups of different sizes - Recognize preprocessing pitfalls such as case sensitivity and the impact of seemingly minor decisions on downstream analysis\nThe key takeaway is that tokenization choices directly affect your vocabulary size and frequency counts—always document your preprocessing decisions and be prepared to revisit them.\n\n\nReflection\n\nIs a dataset created with hashtags such (#covidhoax OR #notomask) and (#covidisreal OR #wearmask) representative of the breadth of conversation on Twitter regarding Covid-19 (at that time)?

In thinking about this, consider how you would address representativeness vs. balance for some imagined task, such as assessing public sentiment about covid or about wearing masks?\n\n\nq1_answer = \"Do you think these datasets are representative of Twitter conversation about Covid-19 (at that time)?

    "text": "C - Distributional Patterns\nFrequency alone is inadequate for revealing patterns of use. Let’s look for high-frequency, low-dispersion terms. Dispersion measures how evenly or unevenly a word (or linguistic structure) is spread across different parts of a text corpus or dataset. Dispersion complements frequency by showing where observations occur rather than how often.\nFor example, a small number of users in our Twitter data could be responsible for boosting the frequency of specific terms. These could matter since they might reveal: - Bot activity - Coordinated messaging campaigns - Copy-paste patterns - Influential user amplification\nDistributional analysis in NLP is a method that finds word meanings by analyzing their surrounding contexts. It gets at “patterns of use” rather than isolated metrics. We’ll dig in much more deeply into distributional analysis because it is one of the most important concepts in both NLP and LLMs.\nLet’s look at hashtags.

    "section": "Step 1: Tokenization",
    "text": "Step 1: Tokenization\nBefore counting words, we need to decide what counts as a “word.” Tokenization splits text into tokens. Using spaCy we can also:\n\nLemmatize — reduce words to base forms (“running” → “run”, “movies” → “movie”)\nRemove stop words — discard high-frequency function words (“the”, “is”, “it”)\nRemove punctuation — strip commas, periods, etc.\n\nEach choice affects what information the final vector preserves. Lemmatization merges related forms into one dimension (compression). Stop word removal eliminates dimensions that don’t help distinguish documents (noise reduction).\nScikit-learn, the library we’ll use below for naive bayes and logistic regression also has a tokenization function. However, since we are learning to use spacy and the spacy pipeline, we will not use scikit-learn’s tokenization or pipeline functionality.\n\n# Just a reminder. If you were not using this helper function, you would use \n# nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n# after ensuring you'd already downloaded this model\n\n\nnlp = get_nlp()\n\n✅ spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' loaded successfully\n\n\n\ndef tokenize(text):\n    \"\"\"Tokenize, lemmatize, and filter stop words / punctuation using spaCy.\"\"\"\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    return [\n        token.lemma_.lower()\n        for token in doc\n        if not token.is_stop\n        and not token.is_punct\n        and not token.is_space\n    ]\n\n\n# What does tokenization actually do?\nexample = \"The acting was excellent and truly moving\"\n\nraw = example.split()\nprocessed = tokenize(example)\n\nprint(f\"Raw text:      '{example}'\")\nprint(f\"Split tokens:   {raw}  ({len(raw)} tokens)\")\nprint(f\"After spaCy:    {processed}  ({len(processed)} tokens)\")\nprint(f\"\\nCompression: {len(raw)} tokens → {len(processed)} tokens\")\nprint(f\"Removed stop words and punctuation, lemmatized the rest.\")\n\nRaw text:      'The acting was excellent and truly moving'\nSplit tokens:   ['The', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'and', 'truly', 'moving']  (7 tokens)\nAfter spaCy:    ['acting', 'excellent', 'truly', 'move']  (4 tokens)\n\nCompression: 7 tokens → 4 tokens\nRemoved stop words and punctuation, lemmatized the rest.\n\n\n\nOne-Hot Encoding: The Simplest Sparse Vector\nBefore counting words across a whole document, it helps to see how we represent a single word as a vector.\nOne-hot encoding assigns each word in the vocabulary its own dimension. To represent a word, set its dimension to 1 and everything else to 0:\nVocabulary: [awful, boring, brilliant, cast, ..., wonderful]\n\"brilliant\" →  [0,    0,       1,        0,   ...,    0     ]\n\"awful\"     →  [1,    0,       0,        0,   ...,    0     ]\nThis is the maximally sparse vector — exactly one non-zero entry out of the entire vocabulary. With 30 vocabulary words, 29 of the 30 entries are zero.\nThe connection to Count Vectorization (next section) is direct: a document’s count vector is the sum of the one-hot vectors for every token in that document.\n\nOne-hot encoding is widely used outside NLP as well. Whenever you have a categorical variable (color, country, part-of-speech tag), one-hot encoding converts it into a binary vector that models can consume.

    "text": "Step 3: TF-IDF — Weighted Sparse Vectors\nCount vectors treat all words equally: “movie” appearing once gets the same count as “excellent” appearing once. But “excellent” is far more informative for sentiment — “movie” shows up in both positive and negative reviews.\nTF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency) keeps the same sparse structure but reweights the values:\n\nTF (Term Frequency): how often the word appears in this document (similar to the count)\nIDF (Inverse Document Frequency): how rare the word is across all documents\n\nWords appearing in many documents get downweighted. Rare, distinctive words get upweighted. The zeros stay zero — same sparsity pattern, more informative values.\n\nTF-IDF Formulas\nThe formula for TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is the product of two statistics, TF and IDF.\n1. Term Frequency (TF): \\[\\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{count of term } t \\text{ in document } d}{\\text{total number of terms in document } d}\\]\n2.

Even words the model has never seen in a given class still get a small probability.\nThe input is sparse (count vectors), but the learned representation is dense.\n\nnb_model = MultinomialNB()\nnb_model.fit(X_counts, labels)\n\n# Learned word probabilities per class\nnb_probs_pos = np.exp(nb_model.feature_log_prob_[1])  # P(word | positive)\nnb_probs_neg = np.exp(nb_model.feature_log_prob_[0])  # P(word | negative)\n\nnb_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"word\": vocab,\n    \"P(w|pos)\": np.round(nb_probs_pos, 4),\n    \"P(w|neg)\": np.round(nb_probs_neg, 4),\n})\nnb_df[\"pos/neg ratio\"] = np.round(nb_df[\"P(w|pos)\"] / nb_df[\"P(w|neg)\"], 2)\nnb_df = nb_df.sort_values(\"pos/neg ratio\", ascending=False)\n\nprint(\"Naive Bayes: learned P(word | class)\\n\")\nprint(nb_df.to_string(index=False))\nprint(f\"\\nEvery word has a non-zero probability — the learned representation is dense.\")\nprint(f\"Words with high pos/neg ratio are the strongest positive indicators.\")\n\nNaive Bayes: learned P(word | class)\n\n         word  P(w|pos)  P(w|neg)  pos/neg ratio\n    wonderful    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n        movie    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n  performance    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n         love    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n        heart    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n       acting    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n        great    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n        start    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n       finish    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n        story    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n   experience    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n    excellent    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n       entire    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n         cast    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n    brilliant    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n      amazing    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n         move    0.0426    0.0227           1.88\n     terrible    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n         time    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n  predictable    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n        waste    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n   absolutely    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n       minute    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n     horrible    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n         good    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n         film    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\ndisappointing    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n       boring    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n          hat    0.0213    0.0455           0.47\n        awful    0.0213    0.0682           0.31\n\nEvery word has a non-zero probability — the learned representation is dense.\nWords with high pos/neg ratio are the strongest positive indicators.\n\n\n\ndef predict_sentiment(text):\n    \"\"\"Classify a sentence as positive or negative using the trained NB model.\"\"\"\n    vec = count_vec.transform([text])\n    label = nb_model.predict(vec)[0]\n    proba = nb_model.predict_proba(vec)[0]\n    \n    return {\n        \"text\": text,\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\" if label == 1 else \"negative\",\n        \"confidence\": proba[label],\n        \"P(positive)\": round(proba[1], 3),\n        \"P(negative)\": round(proba[0], 3),\n    }\n\n\n# Try it\nfor s in [\"I love this movie\", \"terrible and boring\", \"it was okay\"]:\n    result = predict_sentiment(s)\n    print(f\"{result['sentiment']:&gt;8} ({result['confidence']:.1%})  '{s}'\")\n\npositive (77.8%)  'I love this movie'\nnegative (82.0%)  'terrible and boring'\nnegative (50.0%)  'it was okay'\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nLooking at nb_df, note how consistent the probabilities are for the words in this corpus.

    "text": "Step 6: Logistic Regression on TF-IDF — Learned Sparsity\nLogistic Regression learns a weight (coefficient) for each feature. Positive weights push the prediction toward positive, negative weights toward negative.\nWith L1 regularization (“Lasso”), the model is penalized for having many non-zero weights. This forces unimportant weights to exactly zero — the model discovers which words matter and ignores the rest.\nHere is a short tutorial on Lasso regularization. https://thaddeus-segura.com/lasso-ridge/. Read through it, so that you understand what Lasso (L1) does.\nLogistic regression is demonstrating different kind of sparsity than from the examples above:\n\nInput sparsity (count/TF-IDF): most documents don’t contain most words → structural zeros\nLearned sparsity (L1): the model decides most words aren’t useful → learned zeros\n\nContrast with Naive Bayes, where every word always gets a non-zero probability.\nFor this toy corpus, we have only 10 samples. We will demonstrate a logistic regression model by using hand weights, instead of tuning a model via cross-validation.\nThe goal is a demonstration of the sparcity concept when coefficients appear and disappear as we adjust two hyperparameters:\n\nThe L1 hyperparameter will determine which words matter the most and force other weights to zero. It will zero out some of the features (words) to zero so that they contribute nothing to the prediction (vs L2 shrinking coefficients).\nThe C hyperparameter is like a volume control that lets you tune penalty. Ordinarily, you wouldn’t touch this hyperparameter and instead do cross-validation.\n\nSmall C - heavy bias towards L1 with zero coefficients\nBig C - heavy bias away from L1 and bias towards non-zero coefficients\n\n\n\nlr_model = LogisticRegression(\n    penalty=\"l1\",\n    solver=\"liblinear\",\n    C=10.0,              # regularization strength (smaller C = more sparsity)\n    random_state=42\n)\nlr_model.fit(X_tfidf, labels)\n\nlr_coefs = lr_model.coef_[0]\n\nlr_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"word\": vocab,\n    \"coefficient\": np.round(lr_coefs, 4)\n}).sort_values(\"coefficient\", key=abs, ascending=False)\n\nprint(\"Logistic Regression: learned weight per vocabulary word\\n\")\nprint(lr_df.to_string(index=False))\n\nn_zero = int(np.sum(np.abs(lr_coefs) &lt; 1e-6))\nn_total = len(lr_coefs)\nprint(f\"\\n{n_zero} of {n_total} coefficients are exactly zero.\")\nprint(f\"L1 regularization learned that only {n_total - n_zero} words matter.\")\n\nLogistic Regression: learned weight per vocabulary word\n\n         word  coefficient\n        awful      -3.7018\n       minute      -3.5087\n        waste      -3.2676\n     terrible      -3.1018\ndisappointing      -3.0661\n         good      -1.6122\n   absolutely      -1.2166\n          hat      -1.1696\n       boring      -1.1355\n     horrible      -0.7674\n  predictable      -0.7654\n         film      -0.6958\n         time      -0.6131\n    brilliant       0.1014\n        great       0.1014\n         move       0.1014\n        movie       0.0000\n      amazing       0.0000\n        story       0.0000\n        start       0.0000\n  performance       0.0000\n       entire       0.0000\n    excellent       0.0000\n         love       0.0000\n        heart       0.0000\n       acting       0.0000\n         cast       0.0000\n       finish       0.0000\n   experience       0.0000\n    wonderful       0.0000\n\n14 of 30 coefficients are exactly zero.\nL1 regularization learned that only 16 words matter.\n\n\n\n# Compare learned representations: NB (dense) vs LR (sparse)\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 5))\n\n# NB: log odds ratio\nnb_log_ratio = np.log(nb_probs_pos / nb_probs_neg)\nsorted_idx_nb = np.argsort(nb_log_ratio)\naxes[0].barh(vocab[sorted_idx_nb], nb_log_ratio[sorted_idx_nb], color=\"steelblue\")\naxes[0].set_title(\"Naive Bayes: log P(w|pos)/P(w|neg)\")\naxes[0].set_xlabel(\"Log probability ratio\")\naxes[0].axvline(x=0, color=\"gray\", linewidth=0.5)\n\n# LR: coefficients (many are zero with L1)\nsorted_idx_lr = np.argsort(lr_coefs)\ncolors = [\"firebrick\" if c &lt; 0 else \"steelblue\" if c &gt; 0 else \"lightgray\"\n          for c in lr_coefs[sorted_idx_lr]]\naxes[1].barh(vocab[sorted_idx_lr], lr_coefs[sorted_idx_lr], color=colors)\naxes[1].set_title(\"Logistic Regression (L1): coefficients\")\naxes[1].set_xlabel(\"Coefficient\")\naxes[1].axvline(x=0, color=\"gray\", linewidth=0.5)\n\nfig.suptitle(\"Dense vs. Sparse Learned Representations\", fontsize=13, y=1.01)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nprint(\"Left (NB): every word has a non-zero value — dense learned representation.\")\nprint(\"Right (LR+L1): When gray bars are exactly zero — the model learned to ignore those words.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft (NB): every word has a non-zero value — dense learned representation.\nRight (LR+L1): When gray bars are exactly zero — the model learned to ignore those words.\n\n\n\nimport eli5\n\ndoc = \"I love this movie, it was great\"\neli5.show_prediction(lr_model, doc, vec=tfidf_vec)\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n            \n                \n                \n    \n        \n            \n    \n        y=1\n    \n\n\n    \n    (probability 0.827, score 1.563)\n\ntop features\n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\nContribution?\nFeature\n\n\n\n\n+1.505\n&lt;BIAS&gt;\n\n\n+0.059\ngreat\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5) output is helpful to see how the Logistic Regression model reached its decision for the sentence: “I love this movie, it was great.”\nHere is how to interpret it.\nPrediction Summary: - y=1: This indicates the model predicted the “positive” class (where 1 = positive and 0 = negative). - Probability 0.827: The model is 82.7% confident that this review is positive. - Score 1.563: This is the raw output (logit) before it is converted into a probability. A positive score leads to a “positive” prediction.\nTop Features Table: -  (+1.505): This is the model’s “starting point” or intercept. Even without looking at any specific words, the model has a baseline bias toward the positive class because this sentence was labeled positive. - great (+0.059): ELI5 identified “great” as a feature that contributed positively to the score. - Missing Words: Notice that “love” and “movie” are not listed. This is because the L1 regularization (seen in earlier cells) forced those specific coefficients to exactly zero, meaning the model learned to ignore them entirely when making a prediction.\nIn short, ELI5 shows that for this model, the word “great” was the only active evidence in the text pushing the prediction toward “positive,” supplemented by a strong baseline bias.",

    "text": "Key Takeaways\nWhat is a sparse vector? A vector where most entries are zero. For text, this arises naturally because any single document uses a tiny fraction of the total vocabulary.\nWhy sparsity = compression. A document with 20 unique words in a 10,000-word vocabulary needs to store only ~20 values, not 10,000. Scipy’s CSR format exploits this by recording only (position, value) pairs for non-zero entries.\nWhat gets lost? Bag-of-words representations discard word order — “dog bites man” and “man bites dog” produce identical vectors. They also lose syntax, context, and nuance. Only word identity and frequency survive.\nCount vs. TF-IDF. Same sparsity structure (same zeros), different values. TF-IDF downweights words that appear everywhere and upweights distinctive words — a better signal for classifiers.\nDense vs. sparse. VADER compresses any text into 4 numbers — extreme compression, no vocabulary dependence, but nearly all word-level detail is gone. Count/TF-IDF vectors are high-dimensional but sparse and preserve word-level information.\nLearned sparsity. L1 regularization lets Logistic Regression discover which features don’t matter and zero them out. This is compression learned from data, not just a structural property of the input. Naive Bayes, by contrast, always produces dense parameter estimates.\nBeyond sparse vectors. Dense embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) – which we will explore in a couple of weeks – address many limitations of sparse representations by learning compact, dense vectors where semantically similar words land near each other. But sparse vectors remain valuable as interpretable, efficient baselines — and the concepts of compression, dimensionality, and sparsity transfer directly to understanding those richer representations.\n\nq8_answer = \"What did you find most interesting about this lab\"\n\n\nq9_answer = \"what did you find that was surprising?\"\n\n\n# REVIEW ONLY — does not submit\n\nfrom data401_nlp.helpers.submit import collect_answers, parse_answers, submit_answers\nfrom data401_nlp.helpers.env import load_env\nload_env()\n\n# REVIEW ONLY — does not submit\n\nraw = collect_answers(\n    show=True,\n    namespace=globals(),   \n)\n\nanswers = parse_answers(raw)\n\nprint(f\"\\nDetected {len(answers)} answers:\")\nfor k in answers:\n    print(\" \", k)\n\n\nALLOW_SUBMISSION = False   # ← student MUST change this\n\ndef submit_for_credit(student_id):\n    if not ALLOW_SUBMISSION:\n        raise RuntimeError(\n            \"⚠️ Submission is disabled.\\n\\n\"\n            \"To submit:\\n\"\n            \"  1.
